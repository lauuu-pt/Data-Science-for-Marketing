In this project, we acted as data science consultants for the **Portuguese National Tourism Board Organization (NTBO)**, following the **CRISP-DM** methodology to analyze user-generated content such as social media reviews. Our goal was to **characterize visitor patterns** in Portuguese tourist attractions and **compare them with key competitor countries** before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored insights such as **changes in review frequency, rating distributions, visitor origins, and trip types**, and applied analytical techniques like **frequent itemset mining, similarity analysis, and visitor segmentation (RFM model)** to provide data-driven **business recommendations** for post-pandemic tourism strategy.
