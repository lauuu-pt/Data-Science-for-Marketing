I toured the inside , it was pretty packed that day so it was slow moving.. the grounds around  Pena Palce are worth the visit alone.. amazing photos to be taken.. there is so much in this area. I wish I would have explored more.

Unfortunately, only one floor was open as the rest are under renovation.The garden is very lovely! What really amazed me are the tunnels, grotto and most especially the initiation wells. This is the highlight!I suggest that you visit this early in the morning to avoid the crowd. You need to take time to explore the place so plan ahead.

Beautiful streets and shop to buy crafts. The Pena National Palace is a must. Beautiful!

It is huge and the park is vast! If you want to explore the garden and park, then you have to be fit and take time with you.I really like the interior of the palace.Quite extravagant for my taste but really interesting. I recommend you see it.There is a cafe near the entrance and a restaurant in the castle where you can have a bit of rest.

The views are remarkable. If you stay in Ribeira, as we did, walk along the quay to the funicular at the base of the bridge, take that to the top, walk across the bridge, take the cable car down to Gaia, and walk back across the lower part of the bridge - or the other way around. It is great!

We took the train from Rossio station and grabbed the hop-on hop-off bus 12.50 euros/each (which is a misnomer - you are paying for one circuit - we went past the Moorish Castle to start at Pena Palace and could only see the Sintra National Palace - we could not loop back to the Moorish Castle)Even more fantastic on a misty foggy day since you are above the landscape. You will need two to three hours just for the castle not including the grounds.  Nothing more needs to be said if you have seen guidebooks or travel brochures.

The landings between the zigzagging stairways have fountains and statues with a symbolical meaning attached to them.  Some of the landings are decorated with Portuguese pavement (calçada portuguesa).Unfortunately, some of the chapels representing the Stations of the Cross are in a decaying state and should be restored.

We took the train from Lisbon and spent the day in Sintra much of which was on the grounds of Quinta da Regaleira. There was so much to see from the gardens, hidden paths and walkways to the beautiful architecture and detailed stone work. If you only pick one place to see in Sintra this should be the one.

The Ponte de Dom Luis I, built in 1886, is unique because its graceful metal arch carries two decks. By the time it was finished, its span was the longest arch bridge in the world.We visited the upper deck and it was a great pleasure to be there. The view of the Douro river, the other bridges in the distance are unforgettable. Every few minutes a train of the Porto Metro crosses the bridge, but there is nothing to worry, everything is safe.Our feelings were, however, mixed while we were looking at the houses on both sides of the river. Many of them were in a very bad condition: broken windows or even without window frames or roofs - decay and negligence...There is the Funicular dos Gundais near the bridge on the northern side of the river for those who want to visit Ribeira. On the southern side one can take the Teleferico de Gaia.

On the Vila Nova de Gaia side, be sure to visit the “Porto” wineries and listen and learn. Very interesting. On the other side....the city of Porto.... beautiful. Have fun !!Life is wonderful.

What we didn't realize was that they take a select number of tours through the monastery until a certain time (I think 4pm). Sadly we were unable to do that and wished we had. While the Torre de Belem and Belem seafaring monument are also worth the visit we wished we could have spent more time exploring the monastery. It is a wonderful place to see even if you don't make a tour.

The stairs are huge and go from all the way at the bottom of the hill up to the church at the top of the hill.  Great views are had from each step and they are wide enough to share with lots of other visitors. The sculptures found along the path are great and tell a story when viewed in consecutive sequence. The cathedral itself is worth the visit as well, with great architecture both inside and outside. An extremely unique place to visit.

Or try purchasing tickets for the monastery from the Archeological Museum (across the street) ticket line--though can be long but not nearly as long.

One of the most important Lisbon and portuguese military architecture site, related to late Gothic period. It was builded in a river island, almost 600 years ago to defend the kingdom capital of the pirates and maritime invasions. It survived to the 1755 earthquake, remaining as one of the fewest medieval testemonies of Lisbon. It's an unforgettable place and a must to see!

Set high up on a mountain, the castle was once the summer palace for the royal family, as it looks all the way to Lisbon on one side, and out to the west coast on the other side. Tourism through the palace is a well-oiled operation. The queue is lengthy, but winds through every room in the palace, through the domestic quarters, to the diplomat's dining rooms. Everything is preserved well by the caretakers and in great condition. My advice would be to explore the grounds. The perimeter of the castle showcases stunning architectural influences and views of Portugal . There's also a little nature walk through to a small summit that gives you nice views of the castle as well. Apparently public transport is few and far between, so unless you want to walk up a mountain I'd recommend jumping on a tour or hiring a car. Visiting this palace is definitely worth the effort though, it captures a slice of Portuguese history in one of the most beautiful areas in the world.

The iron mooring rings, used by the rabelos, for centuries, are still there, along with the much newer gangways for the tourist boats, and water taxis.We found the Cais da Ribeira to be a bustling place this beautiful September evening. It had a vibrancy, that was not evident, when viewed from across the River, and atop a hill in Vila Nova de Gaia. I was almost sorry that we had an early reservation, as roaming the waterfront looked to offer a lot. However, it was time to find our restaurant.

Truly, this is one of the finest examples of 19th century Portuguese Romanticism.  The architecture is so unique inside and out.  It's an architect and student's dream come true.  The early kings and queens of Portugal lived here and it's so well preserved; so many shapes, colors, and patterns.

This has so many great views of the area and the wonderful colors and building architecture that is not so obvious in the palace brochure.  Speaking of that, make sure you pick up this map at the palace and identify what you will find interesting (it should be everything).  We always make sure to come away with this type of information.

This is an extremely popular tourist spot, and you will experience very long lines probably.  That is, you can avoid or minimize this by working with a local guide (which is what we did).  We tied it in with other major attractions within walking distance.  While this would not necessarily be our top pick of what we experienced in Belem, you still need to spend time and walk through this tower (as we learned one of many original towers used to guard Lisbon from marauders.  There are few of these and this is perhaps the most sustained.  Once you enter, you will walk through interiors where there are the fortifications for cannons; quite a few.  You will be able to pretty much walk through all the areas.  It's quite interesting to observe and understand how the tower guards worked and lived in Torre de Belem.  Be sure to walk the entire fortress, including the exterior areas to capture the detail and history of this site.  I apologize for bringing up this petty small item, but be aware that if you have to use their public restroom (not inside the tower, since there is none), you will have to pay .50 euro to access it.  Seems a little unnecessary since there is an admittance fee already for the tower.I mentioned the Tower was one of three historical attractions.  So, be sure to walk to and soak in the ""Monument of the Discoveries"" (we found this quite fabulous and breathtaking), and Jeronimos Monastery."

We just googled for the information. Also you could ask locals, or at the Bus stop, and you should be able to find out. The cost was very small. We had lots of time at our disposal. We spent one day during which we travelled from Porto to Braga (by train), then to Bom Jesus (by bus) - return trip! We spent about 1 1/2 hours or so at Bom Jesus. We enjoyed walking up all those steps, every now and then stopping to enjoy the unbelievably wonderful views all around. And the views right in front of us, of the steps and then right at the very top, just incredibly beautiful! There is not a great deal you can do at the top, apart from looking around for a short time. There is a church and a few other buildings. There is also a hotel! There is a restaurant as well. And the gardens are lovely. This is a highly recommended visit.

My hubby and I visited this palace in October 2018. We thought that this place is not so crowded anymore around this time but boy we were wrong. Buying admission ticket in advance did not help. The problem was the crowd management the moment we entered the gate. No visible signs, no staff to manage the crowd. We literally felt trapped. The only thing that kept us going was the thought that we already came a long way, why give up at that point. Just heads up, if you wish to see the inside of the palace - do not leave the line. Take pictures of the exterior after you see the interior of the palace.  It’s tempting to stop for photo op when you get to the second landing but it’s a nightmare to get back on the line. If I have another chance to visit this place again, I will skip viewing the interior of the palace. I’ve been to many palaces in Europe, so I reckon this one is not that spectacular anymore. The view from the balcony was very scenic. We also enjoyed the tuktuk ride on our way up and and down.

The church one was moving more quickly, and it was free to get in, so we went in there and had a look around. Very impressive, and nice and cool after the heat outside. Note that you can't get into the church from the monastery (or vice versa), though you do end up at one point looking down into it.Anyway, we came back out, looked at the monastery queue, and decided to go visit the Navigators Memorial instead (just across the park, by the river). I might write a review of that some time. Then we went to see the Belem Tower, had some lunch, and started to walk back towards to monastery. By this time it was lunch-time, and it seems the crowds had all gone to eat. Yes, we had to queue, but not for too long, and we were finally inside.Architecturally, this place is a masterpiece.

The entrance fee is 14 euros per adult, 12.60 euros with a Lisboa card.    This Palace was built in the 19th century by King Ferdinand II as an extension to an existing 16th century monastery and surrounded by a 19th century external wall and battlements on a hill top of 528 m (1732 ft) and was used as a summer Palace.   We walked up to the Palace, there is a shuttle bus that will take visitors up the hill for a charge of 3.5 Euros. My first impression of the exterior of the Palace, with the pink (monastery) and yellow (Palace) walls with the surrounding faux battlements and drawbridge, was being a bit garish and Disneyland-like but it did brighten up the surrounding area plus a King can build what he wants. We spent about a half an hour touring the walls and battlements getting terrific pictures from the scenic views.   Inside the Palace we found what you would expect of a Royal Palace with ornate furniture, paintings, silverware, antiques, bedrooms, halls and a huge kitchen. I especially liked the dining room which had a balcony with scenic views.   This Palace was well worth the visit and very enjoyable.

Most of the European rivers we have been on are very attractive, but this one seems to stand our because there are so few modern ""eyesires"" along the way--think the Amsterdam entrance to the Rhine River for about 50 miles.  There is a very nice railroad line that is on the shore of the river that is well worth the train trip as well.  In lieu of a river cruise, the train is an excellent option that will not take the 7 or so days of a cruise.  There are hotels in the small towns if you want to stay longer--and this is done by many people as a cruise alternative to allow you to have more time in towns of interest.  This is the first bridge you will see if you do a river cruise--and I highly recommend that you do!  The cruise ships dock in a historic area just to the west of the bridge--right under ANOTHER ferris wheel (hey seem to be popping up everywhere).  The view of the bridge is very nice from the ship--unobstructed and a great photo opportunity.  The iron bridge is pure Victorian in both design and construction.  It is a great sight and is a nice one to walk across.  The views are really good from the bridge.  As part of our cruise package we did get to cross it in order to get into Porto--which is a very nice historic city--largest in Portugal.   The number of bridges that cross the Douro is incredible.  They are all very different and all well designed.  They add a lot of interest as you cruise."

The tour company had booked the tickets and we reached much before the crowds reached so didn’t have to wait at all to get in nor did we encounter large crowds inside.We visited just a day after Christmas and yet it was so crowded and I can’t imagine how it would be during the summer. When we got out of the palace, we saw really very long queues and our guide informed us that most people would wait for at least a couple of hours to get in..hence I highly recommend to take a tour company (though it is very easy to do it on your own) if you are doing it as a day trip. If you are going to stay in Sintra then you can easily do this on your own. We were unlucky to have the morning fog over the palace and I could not get beautiful colourful shots from outside. it is a very nice castle which reminded me a bit of Al humra in Spain. There is a little bit of walking to do but anyone in a reasonable health should be able to climb. There is a small restaurant which sells coffee which tastes heavenly on a cold morning! The Park is fascinating too as there are trees from different places in the world. Definitely worth visiting especially if you are romantic at heart! The town itself is also very charming and can have lovely Portuguese lunch after the visit. Most souvenirs available are much cheaper than in Lisbon but the quality is different!

Once we figured out there were 3 lines - one for tickets, one for ticket machines (don't know if they worked) and one just to get it, we were able to proceed.  Ticket line moved slowly but eventually.....    There is a shuttle that will take you partway up if you feel like waiting in another line.  We hiked to the top, feeling sorry for the horses back in the day that had to pull carriages all the way to the door.   Once at the top, another line to get in the palace.  The whole place made me feel like I was entering a Vegas hotel complex - wildly differing architecture, colors, and sculptures.   The inside is ok, not as grand as one might expect, but well preserved.  The line shuffled along, there was no time to stop and really examine the furnishings.   Outside, the views are stunning from every side, if you can get around the IG wannabe stars holding up the crowds with their inane poses.  Even though it was near the end of the day, the line to enter the palace itself had grown exponentially since we had entered.  And people were still climbing up the hill.    I would like to have seen more of the park but we just had to get away from all the people.

Local musicians gather and busk while restaurants, cafes and bars cover the entire stretch.The food and drink is more expensive (not a tourist trap, or a rip off, just more expensive) due to the view, but it is at very least well worth enjoying a drink at one of the many places on offer to take in the view.I also highly recommend walking across the bridge to Gaia and enjoying a view of the Cais da Ribeira from the other side.

You'll see traditional elements like open garden walks and tiled walls, along with more interesting bits like small castle turrets that you can explore, and then a wild array of underground tunnels, bridges, waterfalls, and a 7 story spiral staircase that goes down into the earth.  A tour is just a few Euro and really helped set the stage.  (Thank you Monica!)  The nice lady in the gift shop likes to ask 'did you feel like Indiana Jones?' and the grounds do give that exact impression.

The second floor is being renovated. You can see inside of the Chapel. There are many beautiful pathways to follow all over the property. Several towers to climb up for amazing views. Caves to wander through and be sure to see the Initiation Well (which you can find by wandering through a cave). This property was the best value in comparison to Pena Palace. No problem to bring backpacks and water in. Wear good hiking/walking shoes. There is a small cafe on site. Beautiful property.

The exteriors are quite beautiful and iconic. The interiors are very nice as well, but the rooms are surprisingly small considering it was sometimes a royal residence. It is within an easy bus journey of Lisbon and well worth doing if one has a couple of days in the Lisbon area. The castle sits on quite a high hill so if someone has mobility issues it is best to check if they can take a bus to the top rather than trying to walk the steep road on foot.

The grounds are so large, you can easily spend a full day there: there are gardens, ponds, woods, trails, even farms and greenhouses. We were surprised there was a rather long line to ticket offices even in January so it seems reasonable to buy tickets online or if you plan to visit other attractions (except Quinta da Regaleira) you could get all the needed tickets at once and with small discount elsewhere less crowded. Not sure if the Palace is worth seeing inside considering the additional line to get in, the Park ticket is enough to access the famous terrace.If you have enough time, you may like to walk up to the Palace from the historic centre of Sintra. There are a few hiking paths, you can take one that leads to the Moorish Castle first and from there to the Pena Palace (~1 hour), a very pleasant walk. On your way back try to find the trail via Vila Sassetti, it's a more steep path. Spectacular views included on both ways.

The exhibits were eclectic and interesting and on the whole well labelled. The Palace itself is a beautiful weirdly constructed fairy tale place and was quite eery in the clouds  on the day we visited.I have rated this place as average since I believe more could be done to manage the crowds of visitors. Several individuals were photographing everything with their mobile phones and did not appear to be even remotely interested in what they were seeing. It  appeared to be more of an ""I was here thing"". Even in January this caused additional delays for the rest of us to move at a pace we wanted to. It would be easy to ban photos INSIDE the palace (but not the grounds) and make photographs of the exhibits available to download online as part of the entrance fee."

The old private quarters are interesting and have an array of fascinating furnishings.  Some of the elements of the old monastery (on which this was build) remain.  The gardens are even more interesting, with miles of paths that wonder about the large property.  Outbuildings supporting gardens, horses, and a former queen, are mostly open and worth a look.  There is a cafeteria in a palace courtyard, but there is also a restaurant that nobody seems to know about.  We ate there.  The food was made on site, it was tasty, and reasonably priced.

There are alot of people at this place (even during an off-peak season like January). Try to come as early as you can to this place or be prepared to have to tussle through crowds.The park itself is actually quite large, so you can just take a stroll inside once you're done with the palace.

The park of the place is also stunning, however very very large! Make sure you wear comfortable shoes if you plan to explore it! The only reason I have taken a star off is because of the prices.

We took the blue metro line to Restauradores and then changed to the Rossio Station train. The Rossio metro stop is NOT where the train is located so go to Restauradores for train. We took the train to Sintra. As soon as you exit the train head left to get out of the station and then make an immediate right turn, like a U-turn and walk towards the bus stops. You will be bombarded with tour guides as soon as you exit and they are fairly aggressive. We just ignored and kept walking. Find the 434 bus. Pay cash for the orange line (which is less expensive, a little more than 6e per person). It goes to Moorish Castle, Pena Palace, The National Palace of Sintra and then to the train station. Take the bus to Pena Palace. The bus ride is up a steep mountain road with switchbacks but there are stone walls. If you get off at Moorish Castle first you will have a huge climb to get to Palace. Better to start at Pena Palace and then walk downhill to Moorish Castle. Once you get off at Pena Palace there is a line for the ticket booth. There are also electronic ticket machines on right. We visited on a Monday morning in January and there were not long lines for anything. We purchased the tickets for park and exterior only since many reviews of interior of this palace were not as good as others. Many great photo opportunities so you want to go on a clear day. After you buy your tickets you walk up a very steep hill to reach the Palace. There is a van that will take you and I think it was 3.50e per person. We just walked (with two preteen children). You can walk around the exterior walls of the palace and you are able to enter the chapel with only park tickets. There is a cafe on site too. After Pena Palace we walked back down to the main road and then headed to Moorish Castle. There are many paths that wind through the beautiful park, but we were worried we would get lost since there were no signs. I did buy high top hiking shoes for my children and I am glad I did. Easy to roll an ankle along various places in Sintra. Wear gym shoes or hiking shoes. I did see some women in boots and I am sure it was horrible. You can bring a backpack, water, snacks, etc. After Moorish Castle (which involves climbing hundreds of stairs.) We took the 434 bus back down and got off at National Palace of Sintra stop and walked through the steep, winding streets of downtown Sintra. Many shops, cafes, restaurants, wine bars, shots of Ganja in chocolate cups for 1e and shots of liquor flavored with Pastel de Nata for 1.50e. We also visited Piriquita II for lunch/dessert (Google says it is permanently closed but it was not). After this we walked to Quinta da Regaleira (which was amazing). It is a 5-10 min walk from Sintra city center. Sintra is an all day excursion. We walked about 9 miles while in Sintra.

We got 8.11am train. I think they go every hour. Cost 5 euro return. Sintra is end of the line. Takes about 40mins. A bonus is that the train pasts the Aguas Livres Aquaduct on your left, built 1750.2. At Sintra, go out of the station and along the road (back in the direction the train came from) for about 50metres to the 434 Bus stop. There is a sign, and there will be other tourists.3. The bus costs 7 euro, leaves regularly, and takes you up to the Pena Palace entrance.4. If you got 8.11am train, you will be at the Palace entrance before opening. At the bus drop off point, Palace entrance, there will be a queue to buy tickets, and a queue to get into the Palace once you have your ticket. Buy your tickets first, before joining queue to enter.5. Note that this is tickets for the Pena Palace, and Park only. Do buy tickets to go inside the Palace, as it is well worth it. Cost 18 euro for Palace and park.6. There is a basic cafe in the Palace for coffee and light lunch. Once you have done the Palace, and Park, come out of the same entrance, walk back down the road (about 5 - 10mins) to the Moorish Castle entrance, where you buy Castle tickets. Cost 12 euro. The castle is well worth doing, and has great views.7. Once you have done the Castle, walk back down through the forest to the village. The track down is by the castle guards house. Ask the ticket collector if you are not sure. The walk down to village is easy, takes about 30mins. It is clearly signposted.8. Back at the village you can do the Palacio Nacional if you wish. I did not, so can't comment. The village is nice to wander through, if touristy.9. Walk back to train station, about 30mins walk, and catch train back to Lisbon. They go about every 30mins."

It was the brainchild of the artist-prince Saxe-Coburg, Don Fernando II, consort to Dona Maria II.The castle was built on the site of a former monastery. This was built by King Don Manuel I - Our Lady of Pena - and donated to the Order of the Hieronymites to celebrate the discovery of India by Vasco de Garma. The monastery fell into disrepair after a lightening strike and the 1755 earthquake. It and the surrounding lands were purchased and converted into the royal summer palace. The monastery section is painted red and the palace addition in yellow.The surrounding park is fantastic in itself. It was planted in the Romantic style with plants from all over the world - these are labelled. It can take two days just to explore this alone.So a must visit. There can be 5000 visitors a day in the summer so expect queues. The interior is like a miniature Versailles with the different apartments and furniture belonging to the different royals. Dona Maria died and Fernando remarried an opera singer who became the Countess of Edla and for whom he built a chalet in the park. He bequeathed her the palace after his death but the state purchased it off her, although she was permitted to reside there until her death.

I think it would be a good idea to consider the timing of your visit - I am not sure what it would be like at the height of the season. Also, it is a real climb up from the station to the top - there are buses, tuk-tuks and taxis available and I strongly recommend that you use them.

You can also pay an additional €3 for the transfer from the main gate up to the palace but honestly it’s only a few minutes walk so if you’re on a budget, forget it. Late afternoon on Thursday in January was not very busy at all. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in Sintra!

Good destination if you are interested in the history and architecture of the periods.  It is amazing that it was built so elaborately on top of this mountain so many years ago.  A little understanding of the history and the type of building done in this region will help appreciate it and set expectations.  We enjoyed the visit and glad we went.The park it is in can be a very pleasant walk in addition to the self guided tour of the palace.  Walking from the entrance to the palace is up a steep path but they do have shuttles.It is a very popular site, is a destination for tour groups and can get crowded.  Recommend going early; we were there just prior to opening and got in quickly.  Tour the interior first since that is where the bottle necks will occur once it get crowded.  The exterior is much more open.  Don't be surprised if you see a wedding while you are there.The views from the palace are spectacular and another reason to visit.  There are ample rest rooms and a small place to get something to eat or drink.  Parking is limited and taking a taxi may be an option depending on when you go.  Parking was no issue first thing in the morning."

The architecture is to behold, both internally and externally. We visited the cloister/church only so cannot comment on the additional (€2) museum, but time was of the essence for us. (It still took 2 hrs to do it justice but the absence of fellow travellers helped. (Also within walking distance are two great attractions.)

Stunning architecture and cultural attraction.

(In fact we found the Portuguese to be so friendly and really lovely and this really took us by surprise). Between the hours of 10 and 2 the attraction is free, however this applies to Portuguese nationals only - or so it seems. This was something that was not indicated on the kiosk machine or maybe we just didn’t see it, so we chose this option and printed the ticket. The female attendant must have noticed and barged over, grabbed the ticket out of my friends hand and ripped it up shouting no, pursued by her male colleague who got aggressive along the same lines. No explanation what we had done wrong. Just rude rude rude. We then paid for and printed the correct ones, and again was pursued by the male attendant, who wanted to inspect the ticket and to make sure we had paid. No need for such behaviour, people are generally reasonable. DISAPPOINTING.

Said another way, 4 of the top tourists sights in Lisbon are packed together in a neighborhood called Belem.Although the metro does not go to Belem, and you can’t really walk there from the other tourists districts like Alfama, Baixa-Chiado or Bairro Alto, it’s a short taxi ride (15 min) and there’s also a street car that connects Belem to Cais de Sodré (green line metro).There are plenty of restaurants with river views, so stick around for the sunset, enjoy a few drinks and fresh pulvo (octopus).If you need WiFi, there’s a Starbucks right next to Pasteis de Belem.  Although Pasteis is reckoned as having the best Pastel de Nata in Lisbon, the lines can be outrageous.  I recommend you don’t bother waiting in line; there are many other places to enjoy this delicious pastry treat.  Have fun!"

Inside the tower you can look out from different windows, there was a limited amount of historic information inside. It is NOT handicapped accessible, massive climb, no elevator (built in 1500s), not good for large people because there are very narrow stairwells, not good for people who are clausterphobic. The stairs are so narrow that there is essentially a traffic light to tell groups when they can go up or down the stairs. Overall, definitely a must-see on outside and learn the history.

However, we were riding motorcycles, so I programmed the GPS to take us directly to the site and we rode there. A €1 parking fee allowed us to park very close to the church.Whilst construction of this sanctuary commenced in 1722, there is a history of chapels being built on the hill at least 400 years earlier. The current Baroque style church was built around 1725. The church itself is attractive, but the most stunning element of the sanctuary is the zig-zag stairway that descends part-way down the hill from the church. Each segment of the steps has a unique statue and there are fountains at different levels. Traditionally, pilgrims were encouraged to climb these stairways on their knees! At the time of our visit, part of the church interior was curtained off due to the renovations that were taking place. The grounds also contain a small grotto with imitation stalactites and a pond. There are panoramic views over Braga and a small cafe for refreshments. It is a beautiful location and well worth a visit.

We spent the day at this site and enjoyed the grounds, the castle itself is more special on the outside than inside. The only way we would ever come back here is to stay in Sintra for 2-3 days and tour as early as possible and get out by early afternoon. Much too touristy an area!

My partner however hates all buildings, he much prefers the outdoors, anything with greenery and scenic views. After persuading him for us to go here on our day trip to Sintra I am extremely pleased that we both thoroughly enjoyed the day. There is so much to see and do. Lots of cute staircases to climb up, towers, caves and wells to explore. The majority of the climbs up stairs rewarded up with pretty views of the follys of scenery. I felt like every corner we turned was another pretty building or view. Granted a lot of the staircases were extremely snug, luckily our visit was in Feb so had few other people there so we had no issues with passing others on the narrow spiral staircases. The gardens aren’t full of flowers in bloom in Feb but it’s pretty greenery of trees etc. The map they supplied was well documented, and at each main attraction signage confirmed where you were, plus addition wooden sides at a few crosses paths. All the paths were pretty even and apart from in the caves dry and proper flooring. The toilets weren’t great, old and not particularly clean. The cafe had limited indoor seating but ample outdoor seating. Drinks were reasonably priced. In summary, I love it here. We spent approx 4 hours and would have spent longer if we didn’t have to get the train to catch. I think it’s now one of my favourite places in the world (and since I work for an airline I’m luckily to have had the opportunity to explore many parts of the world). This is one destination I really hope to revisit again some day.

The Tourist info office were breathtakingly rude, the only thing they were interested in selling us was the 15Euro day bus bus, we were only going to Penu and Monserrate so not worth it. I know this is not Pena's fault but read on...No seats for us in the bus so it was a hairy journey on the windy roads standing up on the bus. So first tip, whilst there is parking at Pena beware the roads are narrow and full not only of the 434 tourist bus but also the Hop on Hop off buses and other various tours. So it will be an unpleasant drive under your own steam and there will of course be a charge for the parking.We chose just to see the gardens and the palace from the outside so that was cheap at 7.50 Euros. BUT the entrance is at the bottom of the slope and it is a long walk up to the palace, or you can for 3 Euros catch a mini bus, which I thought was a bit cheeky. The walk up is nice, if you don't get run over by various workmen and the minibus. When you reach the Castelo you can climb the walls and get a good view on just the grounds tickets so we were very pleased with that. I was sad to see this pretty palace up close was in need of a paint job, very sad to see people had scratched their initials into the paintwork, but a quick coat of paint would have sorted that, so why hadn't they done this?The walk back through the gardens was pleasant but being camellia time I expected more of the camellia gardens so was disappointed. I hate to be negative but after travelling around Portugal for a month we were not used to the queues and money grab we found in Sintra.

I'd also recommend taking time to wander round the gardens opposite.I arrived for its opening (10:00) and feel this was a good choice as by the time I'd viewed the exhibitions the monastery itself was getting busy. I'd recommend an earlier arrival.Purchasing a ticket was easy using the ticket machine. You can buy for just the monastery or for both monastery and exhibitions / museum section.To be honest, in retrospect I should have just chosen the monastery. While the Roman jewellery artefacts were gorgeous, I didn't feel the rest of the exhibits were stand out or special and therefore could have skipped those. I also found the staff in this section a little rude. While I understand that not speaking Portuguese is on me, I do think museums etc should accept that tourists will come. The museum section layout is not made clear - there are two parts through doors opposite one another. I did not realise this and felt a little told off by staff. There were also no obvious signs to reflect this. Similarly when entering the jewellery exhibit, there is a security check and a scanner. The guards just stood there and I had to practically walk through before they explained the procedure.The monastery itself is worth all this though. It is a stunning building on two floors with lots of signs detailing the history and bits to explore. It was not very busy (bar a loud school type trip) and it is definitely worth wandering around and admiring the architecture.Overall, if you like old buildings with lots of history then definitely put this on your itinerary. Perhaps just skip the exhibits!

The tram from the city centre stops directly outside the monestery. There are two entrances, one to the chapel and one to the exhibition. We chose to go into the chapel and were delighted with our choice. There was a queue for mass and a queue to go in and see the chapel. Although we are Catholics, we thought we were late for mass and so joined the other queue. There was a man at the door who, very respectfully, goes through an introduction to the chapel and the rules of the chapel. This is in stark contrast to other cities where people are shouting rules at you as you enter. The main area of the church was cordoned off as mass was on-going, but there was a prayer area that we joined. From there, we participated in the mass. There was a lady who, once again very respectfully and in a very friendly way, asks what your language is, then goes and gets the prayers in your language for you.

Given that no visit to Lisbon is really complete without a trip to the Belem district, it's really hard to avoid at least seeing the tower, a striking presence along the banks of the river originally built for military purposes. Eye catching in terms of architectural design, it even feature the first Western European depiction of a rhino carved on as one of its many decorations. While the tower is nice to look at from the outside, realistically if you are down there you'll want to go inside. I have heard of hellish ques, but when I visited in February I basically walked in. For a small fee you can explore its small open section and go up to the roof for some spectacular views of the Tagus and Belem. I'd definitely recommend the Torre de Belem, its a cheap and impressive landmark that anyone visiting Lisbon should at least take a look at!

We chose to walk all the way down to the bus stop (right at the end of the staircase there is a parking lot where the buses stop).

No transport and therefore no extra expense required for the 10 mins walk. When we turned down any of the booked tours from a guiding company near the train station the guide returned and told us that of all the castles & palaces this was his favourite as he felt it was the most interesting. We didn’t want to be hassled while we had a drink, looked at the map and decided quite where we wanted to go. He also disclosed that it is supposed to be the place, from which JK Rowling when staying nearby, got her inspiration for the setting and look of Hogwarts. Having seen it I can believe it, it’s quirky and great fun to look round with it’s tunnels, towers, grottos and stepping stones. It would particularly suit anyone who wants a little history without total immersion and lots of fun.

On a Sunday the trains were hourly, leaving just after the hour. Cost €5 each return and took about 45 mins.This Quinta was about a 20 min walk from the station or you could jump in one of the numerous tuk-tuk/ jeep options that greet you as you leave the station. After our uphill walk (we passed the Palace on the way) we arrived at a wonderland created from an incredibly furtive imagination. Or maybe by a couple of people that were a bit bonkers.Either way, it was a wonderful place to spend a couple of hours. We wandered through caves, up towers, across stepping stones and along paths through a wonderful garden. The Palace was wonderful, but this surpassed it in its eccentricity and attention to detail.If we’d brought the kids they would have loved it. But seeing the efforts of other parents whose children were tearing around the place at speed then we instead sat back by watched them with a wry smile on our faces.The cafe looked quite nice too, although we didn’t use it.One tip: as it’s at a higher altitude than Lisbon it was a good few degrees cooler. I can imagine this being a great respite in the summer, but in early March it was a little chilly for me in my shorts and t-shirt in the shade.

There’s no information about how to see it, so here you go - You enter at the top and can wind your way all the way to the bottom. It gets pretty dark down there. You don’t come back up, but rather go through a lighted tunnel (there’s staff at the bottom of the well if you need help or have questions). The tunnels bring you to a couple of sprigs and ponds, with various routes you can use to exit - one terrifying option or crouching as you walk through the tunnel, another to use the stepping stones across the swamp, or the safe human sized option of a tunnel out of the cave towards the Grotto! Worth a wander, there’s a small cafe, stunning ornate churches, the main house, towers, lakes, grottos, labyrinth caves. It’s great!

But you could take plenty pictures.  We did not feel rushed.  We learned Sintra means ""mountain of the moon"", Pena means ""rock"".  It is know as the palace of the rock (granite boulders).  the pink part is the old and the yellow is the new part built by Ferdidand.  We were in the castle 1.5 hrs.

You'll come to the riding ring with a green hut. Walk behind the hut and go left to get to a path.  Make a righ when you see sign for high altar then when you come to a split take the lower path not marked and follow to end.  It was not that far and it was an easy walk.

The road up to the castle is a windy, one-way cobblestone street. The traffic was awful, there's minimal parking and just arriving from Sintra took over 30 minutes (for 5 km). Then you have to walk several hundred or thousand meters to the attractions on the uneven, hilly roads. Afterwards, there's queuing to buy tickets, queuing to get into the attractions, and queuing in the attractions.We bought the tickets for the indoor tour, which was a complete waste. The inside is divided into a single long queue which tourists are slowly herded through. We walked 20 meters inside before turning around and getting TFO of there.If you're still dying to see the palace, tickets can be purchased from the other attractions as well with much shorter queue times. People with mobility issues (or even just out of shape people); you're not going to make it to the castle by foot, you'd do best to purchase a shuttle ticket.Prepare to waste an entire day trying to get a look at the castle with 5000 other tourists.

I would say one needs the whole day to enjoy all of it, as its not just the Pena, there is a vilage near, that is worth seeing too. We had Local delights there, that tour guide suggested. Yummy. Shortly - Go, Go, Go!

The palace to beautiful  with colourful shrubs, trees, and flowers around it. Old traditional tiles on the walls as you enter telling a story in history. You cross the old draw bridge to go into the palace, inside the rooms are all laid out to how it looked when it was lived in. Each with all the information on the items on display all very interesting.  The palace and grounds are all well looked after making it a great day out.  The views from the top of the palace are stunning you can see for miles, down to the coast or up to the cross on top of a hill in the very distance. and all the  surrounding  grounds.  Well worth a visit.

The colours really are fantastic, especially on a sunny day. Plenty to walk around in the park, which is quite hilly. Park entry is €7.50 per adult (palace is extra, but you can see the vast majority of the palace grounds and courtyards, as well as the wider park and valley of the lakes, without paying that - pay the extra if you really want to see the two or three rooms that are restricted). The hop on hop off bus routes (blue and red route) both stop at the chalet (near the bottom of the park) and the main park entrance (near to the top of the hill), departing from just outside the train station or the village centre.

There is lots to see in Sintra but most people will opt for the iconic national palace.  Here are a couple of suggestions to help you do it better-and cheaper. First getting to Sintra, take the train from Rossi.  But don't buy a ticket for the trip make sure you get a Viagem card for your visit, and use the zapping feature, that way the train trip to Sintra will cost you 1.90 euros each way.When you exit the train get a street map of Sintra (they are free and plentiful) Make your way to the historical centre.  Once there locate the start of the Estrada de Pena, this is the road that goes up to Pena Palace and the Moorish castle, all busses tuk tuks and any other vehicle take this road.  At this location look for and follow the signs through the Villa Sasetti.  The first half of our climb will take you through the gardens of the Villa.  It is a beautiful formal garden like so many in Sintra, the path is made of cobblestones and is well marked.  It is free to walk through and it is better than several similar gardens that charge and entry fee.This garden path will take you a third of the way to the top.  Once you exit the Villa gardens you will continue on the path.  Outside the gardens the path is a little more rugged but still good and well marked.  The entire journey you will be rewarded with spectacular views as you climb higher. Eventually you will come off the trail.(about 50 minutes for us) Turn left goes to the Moorish castle and both left and right show the Pena palace.  It is clearly marked.  We went left it is quicker that way to the main entrance of the Pena palace, but if doing it again I would go right.  If you go left you will come out at the main road up  (Estrada de Pena) and this will take you to the main entrance where all the busses empty along with the inevitable crowds.  Even at the end of March at 10:00am there were crowds.  But if you turn right off the trail you can enter the place grounds at the Vale dos Lagos entrance.  Here the crowds will be smaller.  It is the lowest entrance point to the palace gardens, so yes you will have to continue walking up.  But once again you will be rewarded as the grounds are probably the best part of the attraction.  Entrance to the park is only 7 Euros, the Palace which includes the park is 14 euros. Unless you are convinced you need to see inside the palace I would just opt for the grounds.  The palace is small and crowded you will follow a conga line of tourists through a designated route.  Honestly if you have visited any other palace in Europe you will have seen older, bigger, better and more spectacular.  Remember this was a turn of the 19th centre summer palace so its small and not old.  You will see many rooms decked out as they were but non of this is earth shateringly grand or spectacular,You grounds ticked though will afford you entry onto the palace exterior terraces and allow you to complete the wall walk, which goes all the way around the palace and gives you 360 degree view from the top of the mountain.  This walk gives you the best view of the Moorish castle for photo buffs as you are actually above it. And this really is the point of Sintra, the palace is here because of the views and that is what you want to experience.After the palace walk to the high cross this is the highest point in Sintra, here is the only place you are above the palace and can get a photo looking (slightly) down. Options for getting down are numerous, you can bus or drive but since you climbed up the walk down is a piece of cake. Either road works its flatter but longer than the hiking trail but nowhere near as rewarding. I am sixty with slightly dodgy knees but managed the climb quite easily it took about an hour with stops for a couple of hundred photos!

The palace is stunning from the outside and the park is huge. The problem was that when we tried to look round inside we were not able to get into rooms due to the tour groups filling the place and this is in low season.They really need to have a system where there are timed tickets and limited numbers allowed in at any time, as they do in NT places in the UK,  to make it an enjoyable visit for everyone. I was very disappointed and would advise visitors just to get a ticket for the Park and walk around the outside of the Palace rather than get squashed inside it.

I didn't go inside the palace, and I'd say it's probably not worth it if you are wanting to spend time at other castles.

The park is quite large and features small and large walking trails among wooded areas, small lakes, and viewpoints. Although the rooms in the palace have small signs in Portuguese and English to provide some amount of information, I recommend getting an audio tour to be able to learn more about the history of this palace and the kings and queens who lived there. We were told that in peak tourist season the lines will be quite long, but we were able to walk right up and get tickets quickly, and move about inside the palace rooms with ease. Truly worth the visit.

You can purchase a ticket for the grounds and outside of palace or pay extra to go inside the palace. With the standard ticket, you can get amazing views and photos of the area. The national park was a lot bigger than we expected and we only managed to cover around half of it over most of the day. Would recommend taking the hike up to the Crux Alto, the lakes and the beautiful fern gardens. There are free maps available in many main languages and a small gift shop, restaurant and cafe.Get there for opening at 10am to avoid long entrance queues and definitely don't visit during peak summer times - the experience won't feel as magical if it's packed with people!! We will be back to explore the rest of the park next time we visit Lisbon.

We d tv were astonished at the steepness of the hills and the amount of steps to climb! Not for anyone with mobility difficulties. Gloriously decadent palace with treasures to behold. Circular tour, I’m guessing when it’s busy it’s a bit of a trial, however plenty of space to see everything today. Cafe choice poor, still it’s so busy what does it matter? The architecture is extraordinary, more than slightly Gaudiesque. Our friend recommended the day out from Lisbon and I’m delighted we saw Sintra and it’s palace. Well worth the effort.

Yes it has very attractive architecture, but there it ends. The Portuguese have managed to created complete chaos out of getting people there and back to Sintra. Outside of the train station are various ticket sellers to get you on their buses. We then had to wait about 40 mins for a bus. When I asked for a refund, the rep from sightseeing got all waspy with me. Then the first stop of the bus trip saw a family of 5 have an argument with the driver over lack of buses. That lasted quite a few minutes and held up the traffic behind. The road then narrowed and was one way, but due to the amount of buses, it soon became gridlocked. We eventually got to the venue to be greeted by big queues. I went online to book tickets there to beat the ticket queues, but then had to join the queue for the entrance. Now inside, it’s a pleasant walk up to the palace with great views over the surrounding areas. When we got there, there was an hour queue to actually get into the palace. Once in, it was equally tedious due to the pathway through the palace mainly being one person wide, so those wanting to take their pictures of every detail or read every label held up the rest of the crowds. Yes, the interior is equally pretty but the whole experience was let down by the crowds and poor crown management. Oh, and you only get to go around what seemed like a quarter of the building inside. The staff in the café and restaurant seemed to have one speed, which was slow. We couldn’t wait to get out, but then the bus log-jam resumed. What’s worrying is that this was in March. I can’t even conceive what it would be like in the summer. Just don’t put yourself through this!

The ride to the palace is very scenic. I’d suggest buying tickets in advance and if you can afford a private tour with skip the line option then go for it. There is a lonngggg line, though according to them, it was a low season but the wait was worth it. It’s on the topOf the mountain and if you don’t have knee problem, heart problem, not travelling with strollers and kids, not on wheelchairs, and if you’re not a heart patient and work out every day and have stamina then yes this is your place :) One more suggestion: wear sneakers with THICK sole. Regular walking sketchers or yoga shoes won’t work. Your feet will hurt eventually and it’s up and down, up and down, until you get breathless. Make sure you’re carrying water and something to eat. There are look outs which are great spots for taking pictures. The view is AMAZING! This is a MUST place in Sintra. The entire time you’d wonder how did they even make such a thing so high. I was totally awed.

I’d read a lot about different tours, or how to get there on your own and what to do, so in the interest of saving a few euros (the tour from my hostel is €45), I winged it and got the train.The train from Rossio is great, takes about an hour. I left at about 10.30am. Be sure to buy your Viva Viagem pass before heading to the station otherwise you’ll be queueing for ages! I topped up with €5 and that was enough for the return, just tapping on to get on to the platform. Make sure you walk the platform to the front of the train, it’ll benefit you when you arrive!When I got to Sintra I was out of the station pretty quickly (because I was t the front of the train!) turned immediately right and located the 434 bus. There was a lady selling tickets in the queue, or you can pay the driver. There’s various options or multi-bus tickets, but this one took me everywhere I wanted to go, so the €7.80 hop on hop off ticket was perfect. They all go in a one way loop all the way round. You can walk but it’s a legit hike, there’s also tuk tuks and an “official” hop on hop off bus, but at this time of year, the local bus was great, I went straight to Pena Palace, which took about 20 mins on the bus. I bought tickets for the Park/Grounds only, as I wasn’t too bothered about going inside the palace itself. Thank goodness, because there was a HUGE queue once I was up there for entry. (NOTE!!!! If you are not going in to the palace, ignore the queue that winds down the hill underneath the palace. I stood in it for about 20 mins before realising that you could just walk straight up through the grounds if you are park only! But there was no one telling you that!). Absolutely stunning views, plenty to explore and take pics of! I walked back down the hill and headed for the High Cross. The walk is uphill for about 20 mins, but pretty easy going. The cross that sits on a rocky outcrop is impressive, as are the views of the palace looking back, worth the walk up. There’s a lot more to see/do there as well, I was pretty limited on time, but don’t believe if someone tells you that you need to do an organised tour. I can see the benefits of it, but after I paid for the train, bus ticket, entry to two main sites (Pena Palace & Quinta da Regaleira) plus coffee and pastry in Sintra historic town (Travesseiros at Piriquita are a must!), I spent about €32!

Train from Lisbon was very crowded. We opted to get a tuk tuk to the castle which was a good option. When we got to the castle we had to queue for about 40 minutes for a ticket; initially there was one self service booth open which broke down, and 2 serviced booths. A third eventually opened. It is a bit of a hike up to the castle and the queue to get in wasn’t too bad. Once in we shuffled round because of the crowds. The Palace is ok but I have been to far more interesting places. Once we had got to the Palace, a low cloud had descended on it so we didn’t get to see the views which are one of it’s main attractions. We weren’t in there for that long so it made it an expensive trip. My mobility isn’t great so we weren’t able to make the most of the grounds - they are large and hilly and the various points of interest are quite spread out. Given the cost of admission and getting there I would probably give it a miss knowing what I know now."

At the same time, there was a customer counter with a at least three members of staff doing nothing....would it not be better to have the machines in conjunction with staff selling tickets?  Also you then had to queue again to get into the monastery, those same people who just stood and checked your tickets could surely have just sold you the tickets?

These include conical pinnacles, rounded as opposed to pointed arches and Mudéjar architectural elements of Moorish and Christian.Stunning Santa Maria Church is awe inspiring. In 1497 Vasco da Gama came to pray at a church on this site before setting off on his epic voyage, and his tomb is here. Further associations with maritime explorations are to be seen as we looked upwards to the vaulted ceiling and saw the arrays of bronze discs known as escutcheons with emblems such as the Portuguese Cross, armillary spheres and coats of arms. These used to decorate the caravels that sailed around the world and were so treasured that they were integrated into the architecture, proudly weathered as they endured the voyages of extraordinary discoveries. The Sacristy is divine. Palm-tree styled columns erupt along the ceiling giving a sensational effect. Grand paintings line the walls that also contain impressively dark furniture to house the holy vestments.Another impressive area is the olden Refectory. A vast space with vaulted ceiling stone work and a complete encirclement of azulejo beauty around the walls.Completed in the 1540s the sublime Cloisters are stunning. Over a couple of levels, the pure Manueline creations puts one in mind of the celestial. Conical pinnacles, beautiful tracery and the richness of the carvings are enchanting.

I definitely recommend doing that if you're in shape, if it's sunny and if you have good running shoes.When we arrived at the tower, we were surprised by the amount of people waiting to get inside the monument. We took place behind all of them to visit inside the tower. First floor is king of ""mehh"", with only a few canons to look at. We can take some stairs leading downstairs, to a prison, which is kind of cool to visit, especially since the prison in this tower was probably hell for the prisoners (water coming in, low ceiling, cold rocks, etc.).You can then climb the tower to get on top, which is done by using a very tight staircase that goes round and round until you reach the top of the tower. It's often blocked by people trying to get down while others are trying to get up, so if you're claustrophobic. The monument implanted a nice technic to try to avoid such situation: they put in place a system of green and red light to indicate when to go up and when to go down the stairs, so that the flow is always kept in place.Honestly, this is not the best view of Lisbon that you can have. I suggest going at Castelo De Sao Jorge if you really want a breathtaking view of the city. Going up the tower is a tourist attraction for sure, and I would recommend visiting such a monument, but if I could do it again, I would take in the view from outside of the tower, without paying to go in."

They have a weird traffic light system to control the flow of tourists going up and down the narrow spiral stone staircase.  It mostly works but you always have people that don't clear the passage in time when the 30 second warning beeps start and that causes chaos with a herd heading the opposite way in the narrow staircase.

My husband and I spent 4 days in Sintra and visited most of the famous castles. I took the most photographs here at Quinta da Regaleira. We enjoyed the walk down to the initiation well, crossing the stream, and listening to the sounds of nature. This was our most enjoyable tour. There is so much to see and do in Sintra but unfortunately most people just come to visit the Pena Palace.

Quinta da Regaleira is one fo the most famous touristic points os Sintra and is really beautiful. It is full of amazing gardens and breathtaking constructions. The famous initiac well is really nice and excellent for pictures( although the whole place is).The entrance is cheap but if you can, avoid going there by car, it can be very difficult to park and you may have to walk a lot.For more info, please follow us at @mapamunditravel , send us a direct message =)

The gardens and mansion were beautiful but found the Initiation Well a little bit disappointing as it was extremely crowded and a lot smaller than expected. Still a wonderful visit though!We walked from the Sintra train station which was quite manageable (about 25 mins) but if you are planning on visiting Pena Palace in the same day it will be best value to buy a return/all day hop on hop off ticket for bus 434 at the train station (6.90 Euros) and get off at the first stop in town then walk from there which is much shorter and will take you past the National Palace as well.

Long line at Regaleira but it was worth the wait, and the gardens are so large that it doesn't feel crowded once you are in. (Well, we were there in April, so I can't vouch for summer)The well gets a lot of press. There are many, many fanciful features here. If traveling with children and you want to attempt 2 palaces in one day I would recommend the Monserrat first and this one second. The gardens and house at the first are enough to amuse a fresh child.  The gardens at Regaleira have more things to peep into, climb on and laugh about. Would bring a hefty dose of motivating foods/drinks to get them to walk uphill (to the well). After that should be ok. Restaurant here looked /smelled like fast food and was crazy busy with a dirty small bathroom.

Pick two, maximum of three, places and whichever you want to enjoy the most go first. We picked Sintra first, so didn't get here until after 1pm. Firstly when we thought we'd reached it (on foot) from the bottom of the Sassetti trail it turned out to be the exit. A steep puff up the hill found us at the end of a very long queue. This queue did move well (there are toilets near the ticket office which is helpful while waiting). You can't buy tickets in advance.By the time we got in we were weary, hot and a bit fed up with hills. (not good considering the very steep paths) We also had to queue yet again to go into the well. I think my daughter at this point thought I'd gone insane, but she loved the well and the grotto after. I imagine off season, or first thing, this whole gardens would be enchanting. Just not on a sunny day at Easter!! It is a great place to wander and take photo's but I personally enjoyed the gardens at Pena Palace more. Maybe because earlier in the day they were relatively quiet and peaceful. I did enjjoy the 'Lago' area, when you look at the map its the bottom left hand corner. You could go into these dark little passages (use your phone torch) and I may have made spooky noises to scare the smaller children!! There were a few benches, some near Fonte da Abundancia) and others closer to the exit, so you could sit, drink and have a picnic.We had a cold drink and much needed sit down at the cafe which again was near the exit. Very friendly staff and reasonable prices, sitting outside in the fresh air with the glorious backdrop. All in all reasonable prices but go early if this is your no 1 place to visit. You could walk there in about 25 minutes from the train station.

Although I thought it was amazingly beautiful and intricate, and so much left to explore, I did have a slight annoyance. Most people are looking for the Well. But it’s incredibly hard to find. I know getting lost is part of the charm but after the first 45 minutes the charm wears off. I think they could have better signage as to some of the main spots, particularly the Well.I was ready to give up finding it and came across is unexpectedly thinking it was a seating area. By the time I found it many people were in there, making it a bit cramped and rushed. But nice, still. But at that point my annoyance was a tad high. I still enjoyed it overall and would even come back a second time. Make sure to wear really good shoes because you’re basically hiking.

Sintra and the Castle of Moor's is somewhere you will remember forever... and I can promise you won't regret it! Sintra is a small village approximately 20-30 minutes by train outside the city center of Lisbon. Although quite touristy most of the year, Sintra will make you feel like you were dropped inside a fairy tale book with plenty of enchantment to go around. There is the option of hiking up to the castle and palace, or taking a quick ride on wheels up to the top from the village. I always choose to hike, but be prepared to really get your workout for the day. The views are incredible and I recommend visiting both the palace and castle fortress walls that remain intact. A short trip that will go a long way.

One thing to note, in one of our guide books it said there are four trains per hour from the center Lisbon to Sintra.

There is another line to enter the interior of the palace (tickets are being rechecked), and that can grow to be half an hour or more long, easily. (we felt that the place was overcrowded in mind-April, I shudder to think how insane it might be in the summer.) Interiors are interesting, especially the dining hall, the Belle Epoque Grand Hall, the “3D” Arabic Room, and the kitchen. The cloister is prettily tiled. This is an unmissable point of interest in Sintra even when crowds are huge.

You're pushed through in roughly half an hour, and while the palace rooms are kind of nice they're not extraordinary (especially if you've already seen or are about to see the national palace a few kilometers down the hill) and the view of the palace from the terrace is not that much different to standing in the courtyard. Walk straight past the line into the palace courtyard, take all your pictures, wander around on the walls and enjoy the views, laugh at the people queueing up, and leave. Might feel a bit expensive for just that, but your time is worth more.

We drove to Sintra and from there we were redirected by police officers to the unknown. We managed to loop back to town, but the drive up the hill was nuts. It was going on turtle speed. Didn't know about the parking situation. So I wanted to write this, to make you aware of parking. There are only a very few small parking lots on the hill, plus parking along the road up there and down from there. It's only one way, so there is no going back. We didn't find parking at all on our two hour journey onto and down from the hill. After that we looped all over town to find parking, but we weren't lucky there either. So our advise is to be very early, so you have either parking options on the hill or in town, and then bus or tuk tuk up the hill. Walking is an option too, but it is very steep, and I don't think my 5 yo would have had any energy left to then explore. The alternative is to park outside of town, and take the train into town. We spent hours, and never got to the see the castle or the palace. Very sad day!

The views were stunning and we were imagining what it was like hundreds of years ago; watching the ocean for ships, or invaders coming by land.  We spent about 2 1/2 hours walking around.  If we had more time, I would have liked to check out the Moorish Castle as well, but it was cool looking at it from Pena Palace."

It was raining but that shouldn’t turn people off if you’re able-bodies because you may luck out like us and literally had pretty much the whole place to ourselves with no crowds or strangers in your photos.   The place is beautiful and certainly a photo-op heaven for many.  The layout of the interior and easy explanations make the visit of the inside very interesting as well.  Highly recommended, but then again if you’re already planning to come to Sintra, Pena is a must.  Importantly don’t be turned off by rain because and arrive early because that means much fewer people.  The place can be tight - not quite Belém Tower tight, but certainly not Jerónimos Monastery spacious.  The wall walk is probably a nightmare during tourist season.

This for us was the best option as it was no more expensive than the bus (there were 4 of us) and meant we didn’t have to queue or jostle with the others travelling that way. The palace is truly stunning, both inside and out and provides the most breathtaking views right out to the coast. We arrived at the palace at about 10am and am glad we were no later as the queues to get into the palace itself were snaking down the hill by the time we left. I would recommend heading straight for the palace itself first and then enjoying the views and the outside after to avoid standing in a long long line to get in.

The queue was nearly 2 hours to get inside of the palace, and then you learn you are not allowed to photograph inside the palace. I wish I had been advised of this before, as I would have saved my money from entering the palace. With the park pass you still have access to the terrace which is where the views are anyway! If you are wanting to take advantage of the bus system in Sintra, your Lisboa does not work. There is a lot of advertising for a Hop on & Hop off 15 euro all day bus. But, from the same office as the Hop on & Hop off bus you can get an all day ticket for the 434 bus, which is only about 6 euros and does basically the same stops! If you’re not worried about the hike up, walk! You get to see so much more within the actual forest itself! Just be careful walking the roads as buses, cars, and TukTuks tend to go side by side.

The palace is even nicer. We waited about 45 minutes to get in despite buying our tickets before hand. I would recommend you show up after 17:00 if it’s on a Monday. Lisbon has lots of things closed on Mondays, so Sintra gets a lot of foot and bus traffic on Monday.  After 17:00 there was no line and it still gives you a couple of hours to see the palace.  Worth the visit. I would visit again.

Coming from the UK I can honestly say I've visited many castles, stately homes and the like but seen nothing like this. I've got a few recommendations though to make the day more pleasant. Firstly pick perhaps two places you want to go which gives you time to appreciate them. Next is come early! We used our via viagem 'zapping' cards to get the train to Sintra. When we arrived at Rossio station there was a big queue to buy a ticket, and the train was leaving within a few minutes. The next one was half an hour later! We got the 8.41 train, but wished we'd got the 8.11 instead. By the time we reached Pena Palace it was 10am. This was the train journey (40 mins), walking outside and almost immediately getting a tuk tuk. The lady driver was fabulous, for 10 euro we got a trip up the winding roads in comfort with information about each thing we saw. The lady was local and clearly very proud of Sintra - and so she should be! It was stunning, and the smells of the plants and trees was just gorgeous.Arrived at 10am to walk straight in (small queue) as I had pre-booked tickets. Do this to save time & money, even at that hour (Pena had been open 30 mins) there was a decent queue to the ticket office. Toilets are immediately on your left as you turn up. Then came a very steep stroll up the hill to the Palace. After walking around Lisbon, then Sintra, I must have the fittest thighs and knees I've ever had! You can pay out more and get a bus up, but I was too cheap and made my 14 year old daughter suffer! There is a definite sense of achievement when you reach the top, sweaty and gasping.Don't buy a ticket to include inside (again big queue early in the day). The outside is so jaw dropping you won't top it. Glorious, garish, OTT, the views were astounding. There were parts that other tourists seemed to miss that we got mostly to ourselves. I took a ridiculous amount of photo's!Then take yourself off to where you walked up and follow the signs to the greenhouse/stables. Here I found myself in the gardens of Pena. So, so beautiful. Before midday there were few people to be found. I think most visit the castle then jump back on the bus/coach tour and miss the best bit. Stunning, truly stunning. Wandering around the paths we saw waterfalls, ponds, blossoming plants and the like, ending in the Lakes at the bottom. Truly the best bit of the day, I felt it topped Quinta da Regalaria to be honest.To avoid the crazy roads we then exited through the Lakes entrance, crossed the road, walked through the carpark to the Sassetti trail. You get a glorious view of the moorish castle before descending some seriously steep stairs and setting off down the trail. Its about half an hour through some beautiful woodland. I can't help but rave about it, it was wonderful, peaceful and at times challenging! I had to really admire people walking up because it almost killed me going down! Half way it levels out. We had a lovely picnic sitting on the stone steps at Villa Sassetti, watching those struggle up and down. Go to Pena, don't forget the gardens, walk the trail. The tuk tuk was the only time we used transport all day. Its the way to do it to avoid the crowds.

You still have to face time the entrance line, so:2) Go as early as possible. The train from Lisbon takes 48 minutes to a hour. When you arrive in Sinatra, go through the exit stile and turn left to walk to the bus stop for bus number 434. If you have cash, you can pay an agent outside the bus. Otherwise,the ticket office is on the opposite side of the street for credit card payment.3) Avoid going on a Monday. This is when most tour companies take their multi-day clients to Sinatra and it is particularly crowded.4) Skip the interior, which is beautiful but not particularly unique. Spent your time exploring the grounds and exterior, then hike the short distance downhill to the Moorish Castle, which is worth your time.5) if you book only one private tour in Portugal, this is a good candidate. It is one of the most visited sites in the country. A pre-arranged tour maximizes your time and removes a lot of the hassle. You have more and less expensive options if you book/depart from Lisbon, rather than picking up a private tour upon arrival in Sintra.Sintra suffers from far too many visitors, but is manageable/enjoyable with advance planning. Don’t skip it.

There were tuk tuks, but the roads were wet and we didn’t fancy our chances with their brakes so we took the bus. It took ages and was rammed. For 3 people, it was actually more expensive than an uber!!! Sintra might want to fix that - hardly ideal for the environment. It would be a great place for a picnic, especially in early April when the camellias would have been in full bloom. There are picnic tables underneath which on a dry day must be stunning. It’s a good wet weather activity though, as there are plenty of undercover parts.

But that wouldn’t be a complete tour as the inside is beautiful as well in its history.The palace has a mix of influences when it comes to its architecture which is what makes it an interesting one to visit. We spent close to 2 hours at the place which even included a coffee break.

Got up bright & early and was able to get on the first 434 bus. Was able to get a seat but many people had to stand. There were already people outside the Pena Palace entrance, but the line for people with tickets was incredibly short (again, I arrived early) and I wasn’t even waiting two minutes before being let in. I opted to walk instead of taking the mini-bus for 3 euros from the ticket entrance to the main palace. I consider myself relatively fit & I’m young, but even I was huffing a bit with the steepness. Not a long walk, but the steepness makes it feel a longer.There were people around Pena, but not much and in some sections I had it to myself or with a couple others, views unobstructed. It feels up quickly though. Around an our into exploring (10:30 ish) the line for the interior (which I skipped) was huge and it was getting packed. SO glad I got there early. That’s my biggest tip, try to be on the first 434 bus out that morning. I believe it’s around 9:15 am.I bought my ticket from the driver, 6.90€.

Again, luckily managed to get a seat but be warned.By the end of the day Sintra was packed, and this is during April. Pena was worth it, but I’m sure that when I came contributed to my experience.

There is a bus connection from the train station, which is good as there are quite steep hills in this area. Palácio da Pena is absolutely beautiful, colorful palace. Also interior is worth of visit. Palace is surrounded by beautiful garden and provides nice views. No wonder why this is one of the Unesco world heritage sites.

Unspoilt area with very little tourists anywhere except the palace during our Easter visit.You must visit the Chalet in the park - it is truly something else!Would highly recommend a visit to Pena to anyone who enjoys admiring nature in a peaceful way.

It opens at 0930, be there as soon as possible after this. We made it at 1000 and only had to share the site with 2 tour groups, there were considerably more when we left.The Parque is huge and you can spend lots of time wandering around, you can access most of the palace bar the inside bit on just park tickets.

Located just a short drive from Lisbon it’s a fantastic location with amazing views and great history. It’s strongly suggested to take a bus or private driver as the parking can be extremely difficult. Also, there is quite a bit of walking so come prepared. You can easily spend anywhere from 2-4 hours seeing the various sites depending on how much you want to do. I strongly recommend visiting.

There were parks available quite close although I suspect they wouldn't be there on a super sunny day or during high season.We caught an Uber from our park near Sintra main train station which was a win compared to the 434 bus (better value as a family).  There's poor 3G at the exit, so at the end we had to catch the €5/person van/tuk tuk down afterwards.  Don't waste your time or energy trying to walk this bit - it would take you >1hr and you'd be stuffed afterwards - spend €6 on an Uber and spend the time at the attraction itself!At 11:30am (worryingly late!), the lines weren't nearly as long as we'd expected - we queued for 5 mins to buy a ticket and then <1 min to get into the place.  If you're not easily mobile, don't forget to buy the €3 bus ticket from the entrance to the park to the Palace itself.  You can buy this on board if you forget (cash only).We only got the park pass (€26/family) as the kids wouldn't care about inside and once you've seen one castle's ""rooms"" you don't need to see another (we went last time, 2013) and Pena's is not any different.  What is DIFFERENT is the amazing sculpting and architecture OUTSIDE, so don't waste your time or money with the crowds inside.  There's plenty of shelter if it does (and did) rain outside.We got great photos everywhere of both the castle and the surrounding countryside/towns and well worth the trip.  The kids loved it.  To help summarise my TA homework if you're reading this prior to a high-season visit - remember you can buy a ticket to Pena Palace online prior or at any of Sintra's other attractions, so consider visiting the ticket booth of a ""lesser"" known first if you haven't already pre-purchased when you arrive.  Uber is definitely your friend unless you're solo then the bus might be more economical.  Catch the train from Lisbon (don't bother driving/parking - too painful).  If it's too late and you already have a car, make sure you go to Cape Roca (or Farol do Cabo da Roca) on the way home to maximise your automobile sacrifice - amazing views from the Western edge of Europe!"

I explored Trip Advisor for some insight to parking and couldn't find any, so hence the update. Initial plan was to park in Sintra and get transport up the hill. Free parking was full. On street parking equates to about €4 for a max of 4 hours. As we didn't know how long we would be I was a bit wary of that. Traffic Wardens regularly patrol. Hop On Hop Off bus was €15 each and a Tuk Tuk was €5 per person each way. So my wife and I took a chance and drove up. By the Moorish Castle and Pena Palace there was ample FREE PARKING and that was at 1130. My advice is that if you are flexible it's worth a drive up to see if you can save yourself quite a bit of money. I would also say that if you see a space on the road near the castle and palace, take it, as it's a one way road and you can't return to it

It was engineered by Gustav Eiffel, therefore you will see some resemblance to the Eiffel Tower.  The views from the top of the bridge are spectacular,  and you should really watch the sunset from there. Near sunset, people gather on a hill nearby, have a glass of port, wine or beer and watch the sun set. Music plays, and there is a market to visit. The best way to get there is by cable car, which you catch on the Gaia side, so if you go to the river Douro in the Porto side, enjoy a nice lunch, stroll across the lower part of the bridge to the cable car and enjoy a trip up looking at the beautiful city of Porto.

Various Port houses offer tasting of their products, either for a fee or, if you have a free tasting ticket (collected when buying boat trip tickets are cable car tickets). Boat trips for the Five Bridges trip may be joined on this bank (as well as on the north bank). Take the cable car (Euro 6 one way) to the upper deck of the Pont de Luis bridge. Walk across the bridge, stopping to enjoy the views (better downstream), watching out for the trams that trundle across the bridge.Look for the Cathedral to your left with the distinctive 2 towers and walk past it and the Museu de Arte Sacra e Arquelogia towards the west. Look for yellow arrows that indicate the steps to take to descend to the river bank. About halfway down the yellow arrows reverse direction but by then it is easy to see the rout down. Take care as the steps are steep and old, so are worn and could be slippy when wet.Allow at least 1 hour for this trip but 2 would be more relaxed. There are many restaurants on the south bank which, when we were there, were much less busy than those on the north bank.

It's free to cross the bridge. The bridge provides a high level pedestrian access and a low level. The high level access is across from Porto Cathedral [Se Catedral Peso Episcopal] and descends onto the bridge access via a short street. There is a pedestrian walkway on both sides of the bridge with an overground metro line in the middle. There are protective bollards separating the pedestrian walkways from the metro line. Truly unusual to see. Great views of the city and Duoro from this bridge access. At the exit at the other side in Gaia there is a large park where you can rest before  continuing in to Gaia itself.The lower access again contains pedestrian access on both sides of the bridge which are separated by a road allowing access to Gaia for vehicles including buses. The exit in Gaia provides access to the river bank where the main port cellars are and there are small stalls along the river bank as well as bars and restaurants. At the Gaia side of this bridge young men dive from the bridge into the Duoro after a money collection from the gathering crowds awaiting the diving. A hop on hop off bus service is availble throughout the city and is a good way to get to the bridge but the service finishes at 17.30 hrs. At the Porto side of the bridge is the area known as Ribeira which is full of bars and restaurants and a favourite place for the young.

I would recommend getting here before it opens to buy your tickets as it gets very lined up. Tickets are sold at the entrance to the archaeology museum. When you get off the tram, the first entryway you pass is the entrance to the church and monastery, then the next entryway is where you buy your tickets. Belem is about a 30 minute tram ride on the E15 from Cais do Sodre, however this is a very busy stop so if you would like to guarantee a seat on the tram you should catch the tram from it's first stop at Praca do Figueira.

So I had to go back outside into the rain, turn left and go into another entrance to see the cloisters.They were indeed as beautiful, breathtaking and photogenic as I hoped. They were also swarming with tour groups who were taking selfies or letting their kids run around in the grassed area in the middle. This meant waiting patiently to be able to take photographs without some kid swinging around an umbrella!Apart from two rooms off of the cloisters that was it! (Although the toilet was helpful!) I was very disappointed, especially as the church attached is free to enter, and probably just as stunning. If you feel you don't want to spend 10 euro on little as I did, take photo's of the front of the building. (Which is amazing). Then looking at the building ignore the massive queue to get tickets and watch the smaller entrance (on the right as you look at the building) where you will see people going in and out. The entrance to the church is the far right of that entrance. The church is breathtaking too and FREE.

When we reached at around 10:15 the queue for tickets was about 30 people strong. But due to only two ticket machines it took us 35 minutes to get our tickets. By 11 the line was so long that the people would have easily queues up for close to 2 hours just to get the tickets. The ticket machines are situated at the entrance to the museum and there are 2 queues: one for the museum and one for the monastery although I do think you can get tickets for both or either from any of the machines. But the lines are segregated and we thought best to stand in the correct line. After getting the tickets you head back to the entrance of the church and monastery where the tickets are checked. Have to mention that holders of the Lisboa card did not have to queue and could go in directly.The church and the monastery cloister are magnificent. We spent close to an hour exploring both the monuments and it was fairly crowded. The intricate carvings of the buildings are exquisite and it is indeed a beautiful place. The Padrao dos Descobrimentos is right across from the road on the waterfront and the Belém Tower is at a walking distance as well. So if you are walking out and about in the area there is plenty to explore.

You can't miss it, it's the first place right next to all of the bus stops at the start of the Belem area, in a pedestrianised park area.The church is well worth a visit, huge, astonishing how anyone could build with such vision in the 1500's! it was so noisy inside - I was amazed, a constant rumble of voices, despite the loud speaker requests for silence, people were jabbering away - even tour guides on their headset microphones! I get that you may not be religious (I'm only there for the architecture!) but come on - respect other peoples beliefs and the purpose of the building!It was interesting to see the empty tomb of the 'longed for' young King, who never returned from battle and the tomb of Vasco de Gama (reinterred in the 19th century) But the scale of the building and the whole site has to be seen to be believed.

Note that the river's tide has about a 12-hr cycle with high tide  and low tide about 6-hours apart. Sometimes the tower will be surrounded by water, sometimes by mud. The immediate area around the Tower includes many sights to visit.

The surrounding land has been created from fill so that the tower is now easily accessible. Not by accident either. You could imagine it’s value as a defence post and a point to welcome home coming travellers back in the day. The surrounding park is just what every foreshore needs. There are places to eat here as well although limited in number and variety. If you can get a seat though the food is fantastic.

It’s a nice place to visit and certainly a nice landmark.  But having been there, I would not recommend going when the lines stretch too long and when the weather is too unbearable.  For a nice top view of Lisbon, perhaps consider Cristo Rei across the water which is much higher, more panoramic, has more space just in its park, breezier and so easy via ferry/Uber.

Numerous restaurants and cafes cater to the crowds and it is a buyers market as they all posture for your patronage. It's a souvenir seekers paradise but be sure to shop around. Take time to explore all the details and different views that present themselves. There are multiple signs providing helpful information regarding the long and interesting history of what has long been one of the most vibrant sections of the city.

Definitely worth some time and, as others warn, be prepared for a lot of walking (including a good amount uphill)  both to get there and to wander the grounds and gardens.

It's a different entity than the other attractions, so we had to stand in line to buy a ticket, but it wasn't too bad.  The gardens are shady and serene with different castle replicas and buildings.  The well is an interesting experience.  Not for the claustrophobic, and you have to walk across a pond on stepping stones to exit.  The palace near the entrance is a beautiful place, with exquisite tilework and wood carvings.  And the cafe is a good place to stop and have a drink and enjoy the views.  You could spend several hours here, easily.

We found a lot more surprises there than the initiation well with the gardens being absolutely stunning and well kept, there are statues and grottoes, fountains and waterfalls. The architecture of the Palace makes it look like a magical fairyland with many Gothic and Manueline features, including gargoyles, turrets, an octagonal tower, frescoes and stuccoes. There is a beautiful matching Chapel opposite the front facade of the Palace.Look out for the hidden surprises if you go down to the bottom of the well because you then have to negotiate the underground secret passageways back out into the gardens.This was a fabulous place to visit and I would recommend it to anyone.

The house has an interesting exterior and some beautiful interior wooden accents. Located just a short walk from town, this is one of the most convenient Sintra attractions to visit. When you enter you are already part way up the hill so we chose to head to the top of the park and work our way down. The park was very lush with a wide variety of trees and flowering plants. Scattered about are various whimsical and magnificent structures with towers, wells, tunnels, and grottoes. These structures meld beautifully with the abundant vegetation. One of the highlights is the Initiation Well (the cool spiral staircase that you see in all the pictures). There was a line to enter but it moved quickly and the unique experience was worth the wait. Don't be put off if you have to wait at the various towers and other structures, in a few minutes the crowds will move on and it will be your turn. In the process you will have no problem finding your own personal secret spot at Quinta da Regaleira.

You can only purchase the ticket at the Quinta itself so no need to pre-buy. After grabbing our tickets we proceeded to the cafe to get a latte to amp up some energy to explore the regaleria. It was the right decision, as soon as you start exploring the property you are transported to a giant play area with secret paths, tunnels, castles and just about anything to bring the kid out in anyone and everyone. Although there were lots of people all throughout, it is so spread out that you often find yourself as the only people in a miniature turret looking out over the grounds or an underground gave with dripping stalactites. We went at the end of day so that may have also helped.Allow plenty of time to explore, my wife wanted to explore all the nooks and crannies and see where all the paths and tunnels led. Like a child at the playground, it was great fun.

Take a map so you do not miss anything, especially those amazing grottoes and wells.  The building itself is the final thing to see and each room is amazing.  There are also great views from this property.They offer a senior discount and if you cannot walk from the train station (which I estimate to be 30 to 35 minutes), take a Tuk Tuk or cab---forget the busses which are really designed for the other sites and which seemed to travel in clusters with long waits in between.Make this a definite on your visit to Sintra.

My favorite parts were the grotto, underground dimly lifted tunnels and the cascade and ponds with the stepping stones (I almost lost my balance) from here you can walk to the bottom of the Initiation Well. You can climb down coming from above but you can't climb up from here. Another favorite is the Ziggurat. From the top you you have a wonderful view of the Moorish Castle above. The ""Portal of the Guardians"" is also quite impressive. Apart from this and many other interesting objects the park is very well laid out with some very interesting plants.

I have seen a lot of reviews saying that it’s a 5minute walk from town, believe me, it is not 5minutes it’s around 12minutes with a few hills and ticket access is on the far back side of the castle. The Initiatic well is amazing!! Try to beat the tours, if you see a tour ahead try to go in front of them or wait behind. Lots of great sights!

You can see the ruins of an 8th c. Moorish castle. The current palace dates back to 1839, when King Ferdinand II bought the ruins of the Hieronymite Monastery of Our Lady of Pena and started to adapt it for use as a residence according to his romantic taste. A ticket for the bus that goes from the Pena gate to the palace is needed if you want to avoid walking uphill. The gardens are huge and will take over 2 hours to see most of them. At the end of the lower garden is a cute castle tower in the middle of the pond for the ducks. The café at the lower entrance offered delicious pastries and drinks. There are a couple of tables to sit at. I enjoyed my delicious raspberry and cream muffin and coffee before walking uphill to the parking lot.

The train ride is about 40 minutes.The palace is not in town, but up in the mountains, so it requires some energy from the train station to get to it. If you like hiking, it's certainly a beautiful walk! So to get to the Palace you have to go up a hill, if you don't walk, you can do that by tuk-tuk, taxi or a bus. They are all around the train station.Be sure to bring cash, the taxi and tuk-tuk do not take credit card.We took a tuk-tuk up it was much quicker (and fun!) than doing the line for the bus.Once you get to the entrance you have two options with different price : visiting the palace exterior and the garden, or the same plus a tour of inside the palace.I would strongly recommend NOT visiting the inside. The lines to go inside the palace are extremely long, it took us almost 1 hour, and once inside, you do the visit in the same line (elbow to elbow) at the same pace. The inside was very ordinary compared to the exterior. In my point of view, waiting in a queue to see the furniture inside the building was not worth it. If you buy tickets just for the Palace and the garden, you'll enjoy a free access to the many terraces and see the colourful towers, the chapel room in the palace, plus the bathrooms, gift shop and cafe. You just have to walk next to the hundreds of people in line to go straight to terrace. The line is only to go inside. All the beautiful picture of the Palace are taken from the outside, you will see everything you need to. We highly recommend buying tickets in advance on your smart phone! After you get your ticket at the entrance, there is another 10-15 minutes uphill walk, there is also a small bus which can take you to the top for a small fee. Bus or not, bring your comfortable walking shoes.It drops 10 degrees from Lisbon to Sintra, so no matter how is the weather in Lisboa it will be a lot cooler and rainier for that matter in Sintra. Bring an extra coat!The Palace is just spectacularly beautiful with many different styles of architecture to admire. The colors and landscape of this castle are breathtaking!! Not your average palace! Not like anything we have ever seen! Truly unforgettable!Warning to those with walking troubles or a fear of heights, much of the palace is enjoyed from the outside. There a lots of stairs and sweeping views from high up.Sintra is beautiful, when you are here, don't miss the two castles nearby (Castelo dos Mouros and Quinta da Regaleira). We did all three in one day. We travelled to the top to Pena Palace first and then walked down to the Moorish castle to finish with a last walk to the Quinta da Regaleira. A must do for everyone traveling to this area!!!

We did not spend time in the Park grounds but entered the Palace and toured at our own pace (1-2 hours). Our day-guide actually  had us arrive after lunch as the crowds have begun to thin out at this time --- a short wait for the shuttle bus up the mountain, no lines for entry and not crowded inside.The colorful exterior of this Palace is so integrated into the mountain that it appears to have been carved from it rather than built on it. The views are outstanding and the detail and preservation inside is very good; a surprisingly large portion of the interior is available to the public. It's definitely worth including as part of a visit to Sintra."

From the drop-off place, you either must get into another shuttle bus or climb the hill through the park (recommend that)   Once you've arrived at the palace, get up the quickly and get in line.  We were there early and still had about a 20 minute wait --- as opposed to a several hour wait if you come later.

I wish I had not paid to get inside, however, because once we went around the outside, the line to get inside (which you cannot skip) was very long.  We weren't about to waste our day waiting in that line, so we had a coffee on the rooftop terrace and left shortly afterward.  So my advice is: buy a skip the line ticket online, and just buy a ticket for the grounds, not the inside.  Get there early and start your Sintra day there.

We based our route on the excellent report by msbsouthend (April 2019).  This is an account of how we achieved our aim.We took the 8.41 train from Lisbon Rossio to Sintra.  The date was Tuesday 21 May - there were no queues at the ticket machines at Rossio and the train was only about half full.  Arriving at Sintra (at about 9.20), we visited the ticket office just outside the station (round to the right) and bought tickets for the Pena Park (grounds only) and the National Palace of Sintra.  Again, there were no queues.  We then walked to the bus stop and immediately boarded the 434 bus bound for Pena (no waiting, bus fairly full, but not overcrowded - we easily found seats).  The bus went straight to Pena (not via the town).  We then took the shuttle bus up to the Palace (about a five-minute wait, cost 3 euros each).  After reading TripAdvisor reviews of Pena Palace, we had decided not to go inside the Palace, but to visit the National Palace down in Sintra later - I think this was the right decision, as you can see most of the Palace without paying extra to go inside.  As expected, the Palace was very busy.We then returned to where the shuttle bus had dropped us off and found the entrance to the Palace grounds (well-signposted), down a flight of steps.  We decided to deviate slightly from msb's route and include Cruz Alta on our walk.  (Yes, we knew that this would involve some climbing - Cruz Alta is the highest point in these hills - but we always had the option to retreat if it got too difficult.  In the event, the uphill bits were minimal and easily managed.)  The signposting to Cruz Alta was excellent.  The final ascent to the cross is up some steps to the right of the wide paved track we were on.  My wife opted to wait while I did the final ascent to the top.  Now something very bizarre happened - I could not see the expected view of Pena Palace!  I walked round the cross a few times, but no Palace.  I then descended the same way as I had come, but decided to have another attempt to find the viewpoint.  I turned right (uphill) along the paved track, until there was a second (and easier) flight of steps on my right, leading up to the cross.  I climbed these steps - and immediately saw the classic view of the Palace!  I have no idea why I couldn't see it the first time.  Even more bizarrely, as I descended the same steps back to the paved track, I was aware of someone coming down behind me.  When we both got to the bottom of the steps, he said he had expected to see the Palace, but that ""the trees must have grown.""  I showed him the photo I had just taken of the Palace and sent him back up the steps.  I hope he found the viewpoint!Now it was all downhill.  We followed the signs to the Lakes and walked through the ""Valley of Tree Ferns.""  We left the park at the Lakes entrance, crossed the road to the car park, and then followed signs to the Sassetti Trail.  This first involved a (very modest) climb to a viewing platform, from where there is a good view of the Moorish Castle.  From the platform, the Sassetti Trail (signposted) goes very steeply down steps.  (This path is extremely steep in places and care is needed - however, we had no problems negotiating it.)  After a while, the steps finish and the path levels out (and is in much better condition).  When you come to the entrance to the Vila Sassetti grounds (a gateway), Sintra is signposted down (steeply again!) to the left.  Ignore this and enter the grounds of the Vila Sassetti (a signpost soon confirms that this also a way down (and a much easier one) to Sintra).  The rest is easy.After lunch at a restaurant with a superb view of Sintra, and especially the National Palace, we waked down into the town and visited the Palace (separate review).  We later walked back to the station for our return train to Lisbon, after an excellent day in Sintra.Tip - if you are want to visit Cruz Alta, follow the signposts from the Palace area, but ignore the first set of signposted steps on your right.  Instead, continue along the main track to the top of the hill and ascend the second set of steps on your right.  Go to the right of the cross and you should see the Palace!"

While Versailles, Schonbrunn, and others dazzle by sheer size and opulence, with Pena it is location, location, location. Its situation is breathtaking, perched on a rocky outcropping high above Sintra with sweeping 360 views of the town far below, the Moorish Castle nearby, and the Atlantic ocean in the distance. A visit to Pena is an adventure that includes getting there, so buckle up and enjoy the ride. Unless you have booked a tour that includes transportation to the palace, your most economical option is a public bus (#434 which has its own TripAdvisor page) which can be crowded but gets you from the Sintra train station to the palace at a reasonable cost with a minimum of effort. We visited on a Thursday morning in mid-May and the summer crowds were already in full swing. We caught the first bus from Sintra station but a lot of groups had already arrived at the palace by the time we did. Our pre-purchased tickets (you buy a ticket that is good any day through the end of the season) saved us a little time at the front entrance. From the entrance it is a stiff 10 minute climb up to the palace, unless you splurge on the tourist train that travels throughout Pena park. The approach to the palace is slow, mostly because everyone is looking upward to gawk and take photographs. We entered the palace itself immediately and we were glad we did because by the time we finished our visit the line to enter was quite long. Even though there were quite a few people moving through the palace as we were, the crowd moved quickly and we were usually able to get good pictures by waiting a couple of minutes for a lull in the crowd. The interior of the palace is richly furnished, well-explained, and beautiful. The views from the windows and terraces are spectacular, both of the palace itself and of the surrounding country. The park is vast and one could spend hours exploring it. Our schedule only permitted about 45 minutes of wandering so we made our way down to the Vale dos Lagos and this was a very satisfying route. We will not soon forget our visit to this technicolor wonderland and neither will you.

We arrived at the castle approx. 10:30 am and were able to skip the line (very small) to purchase entrance tickets. We had to wait approx. one hour in line to enter the castle - worth the wait as it was a pleasant tour. You can still get some great views and pics if you don't buy the castle tour but why bother going all that way if you just want a pic from a viewing plaza. The train ride from Lisbon took about 30 minutes. You can catch the train at the Rossio train station (not the Rossio metro stop). If you purchase your train tickets in the morning you will have to wait in line for approx. 30-45 minutes. We purchased our train tickets the night before and didn't have to wait to get on the platform. Trains run frequently so you have flexibility in timing your trip.Once you arrive in Sintra you will be bombarded with Tuk Tuk offers and private drivers. You can walk to the palace if you're so inclined but it's a long haul. The city buses are right outside the train station and get you there efficiently. Once you are done your castle tour you can catch the city bus to another destination - this part can be tough as it is a free for all trying to get on the bus - no queuing rules in Sintra. You may wan to consider a Tuk Tuk at that point for a hassle free ride to your next stop.

We arrived at the palace complex at 09:40 (the grounds open at 09:30 this time of year) and were able to find parking for our car and buy tickets quickly. There was already a queue to enter. We managed to walk up to the palace entrance (a steep climb) before most of the people ahead of us in the queue, including those who took the shuttle. As such, we didn't have a wait to enter the palace. It was also a great opportunity to get photos of the outside of the palace before people were swarming its balconies (take a few snaps before you head in!). The palace itself is definitely worth seeing, and would probably have been more meaningful with some guidance. (We saw people with audio guides, but did not know they were an option before going in. There is also an app you can download, but we didn't have earphones on us. We used audio guides for our tour of the National Palace, and they definitely added to the experience.) The outside of the building and the views over Sintra are just as beautiful.Be sure to leave enough time for the palace gardens! We loved walking through them, and there are a few viewpoints from which you can see the palace in its entirety. If you can get there at 09:30, I would suggest allocating an hour-and-a-half to two hours to the palace, and at least another hour-and-a-half to the gardens (we wished we had more time there).While I was disappointed by the number of people who were there at opening time, I realised that we had indeed beat the crowd when we made our way to the gardens at about 11:00.

This was beautiful with lots of hidden gems. The Chalet e Jardim da Condessa D'Edla is really worth visiting! The palace itself is beautiful, really breath-taking both inside and outside. We visited in May, NOT the peak season, and yet we were in a long queue to get in and the ""queue"" continues through the whole palace tour. It felt a bit like cattle being herded through! Also, prices are steep, including in the cafe and shop, which have woefully slow and poor service. Up close there are many signs of tiredness to the building fabric. The National Trust would look after this property better. It feels a bit like the current operators are milking visitors at every opportunity to visit a wonder built by earlier generations."

Walk from Sintra via Setais palace up to the hill of Pena went via narrow and not well kept paths, but well away from tourist crowds. Walking down to the old center via Vila Sasseti hiking trail was a good choice. This is the main trail between the old center of Sintra and Pena. The surrounding national park would offer nice routes for several days. This is a good option to enjoy nature without massive crowds of tourists which occupy all places around Lisbon in summer tome. Of course, if you so wish, you can join the crowds and take the bus from city to Pena.

From there we crossed the road and walked the trail up to the Moorish Castle.  After exploring the castle remains, we walked all of the way down into town again and visited the Palace in the Center of town.Our advice is first to check the weather.  The Pena Palace is beautiful and has amazing views but really it looks more beautiful from a distance when you can appreciate the bright colors.  The gardens and lakes were amazing and I would allow more time for that then the building itself.  Then for the Moorish castle, it is ALL OUTDOORS and you must be prepared for many steps.  It was fun but it was rainy and there is no coverage from the elements.  Then if you have the time and energy definitely walk back into town.  The Palace in town is, in our opinion, not worth the time.  The nearby private Quinta da Regaleira is so much better!So plan your trip and unless you are really sure you want to commit to all 3, do not buy a package ticket.  We would recommend more time at the Quinta da Regaleira which is private and not included in any packages.Also, it is extremely crowded even on a rainy day so go as early as you possibly can and start at the Pena first and work your way down.Better plan overall is to stay overnight in Sintra (we enjoyed the 1012 Guesthouse) so you can maximize your time there.We used our app on our phone and literally walked 49 floors on one day and over 30 on the next!

(no fast lane) That was only a 15 minute wait which was good. As walking is difficult for me, we waited in line for 25 minutes for the shuttle that takes people up to the castle. That was pleasant enough as we talked to others in the line. When we finally got to the front of the queue to board the bus they asked us for our ""ticket"". We showed them the entry ticket but no, we needed to buy an extra ticket to get on the shuttle. And we needed to go back to the front gate to buy this ticket then LINE UP AGAIN IN THE QUEUE. We looked everywhere for the sign that told us this. There was none. There was an employee trying to supervise the shuttle queue which was now longer than before. I asked him why no-one told us to purchase a shuttle ticket and why there was no signage and his response was we ""should have asked""!Overall, there is a general lack of simple information that would make everything so much easier. We spent more time waiting to get INTO the Palace than we did actually IN the Palace. And this particular day in the 1st week of May wasn't that busy.Disappointing."

To visit Pena Palace and the Moorish Castle allow a good few hours to explore the surrounding gardens etc. We walked up from town through the gardens and did the entire circuit which is wellWorth the physical exertion although you would want to be reasonably fit as it’s mostly uphill with many stairs. Wear good walking shoes! Ticket sales start at 9.30 and this place gets super busy so I recommend getting there right at 9.30 to purchase your tickets and go directly to the Pena Palace without delay to avoid long queues. The palace is jaw dropingly beautiful. Take time to explore the grounds and then make your way to the Moorish Castle. You can walk the wallsIf the castle (again wear good footwear!).

For about 45m standing in sun and shade we got inside the castle. We thought it had some nice elements and was worth the wait. We skipped the restaurant/cafe because it didnt appeal to us and with another uber you are anywhere else fast.

We arrived at the palace around 10 am. Glad it wasn’t later. Tour leader purchased tickets quickly but we had to wait around 20 minutes to get inside. I found out later that was good! Once inside you walk through in single file through the royal residence. It takes a long time as you are waiting for tour groups and others to grab selfies, take photos, and stumble through the place. Many of the tourists are elderly and not very nimble. Lots of crutches observed. There are plenty of steps, etc to navigate for those with mobility issues. Although you can buy tickets in advance for the palace, you still have to queue once you arrive. There is no time slot specified on the ticket, first come , first served. If you get there around noon or early afternoon, you will be waiting at least 90 minutes, maybe 2 hours. And this is in May. I can only imagine what’s like in August during peak season. TIP: get there at 9 am when it opens to avoid the queues or go late afternoon around 5 pm.I can’t say I was that impressed with the inside of the palace. It’s not worth waiting 2 hours in a queue. If you find yourself in this situation, just go to the terraces and patio portion of the palace which is free. That’s where all the photo ops are. Walk the trails adjacent to the palace if you are able. Some beautiful trails in the surrounding woods. Also, skip the shuttle bus from the bus drop off up to the castle. Long queues for that too. It’s a 10 minute walk.Overall, I’m glad I went but I’m glad it was earlier in the day. Even then , there were lots of tour groups, buses, minivans, and so forth. If you are reading this in July or August, you had best get yourself up there as soon as it opens or be prepared to spend hours queuing.

The park and gardens are lovely, with an eclectic mix of vegetation from all over the world.  The palace, whilst it looks vibrant in the photos, is looking a bit tired and run down.

The mix of styles turns it into a fairy tale castle. Anyway, buy a one way ticket on bus #434 (as we will be walking back to town via the Moorish castle). There are 2 stops. The first stop is at the ""Lakes/Lagos"" entrance and the 2nd closer to the official entrance from where you can take a bus (at a separate fee) up to the castle, or walk up. Both entrances have ticket offices. When entering at the ""Lakes/Lagos"" point you'll walk uphill through the beautiful park to the castle, something you can do in reverse when doing the castle first. Not too far from the ""Lakes/Lagos"" entrance is a path to the Moorish Castle. When going through the main entrance you'll notice a long line of people waiting for the bus that takes them along a winding road up to the castle. Skip it if you are in decent shape. It's not a long walk. A bit steep, but not super so. We didn't buy a ticket to go into the castle. The only thing you'll mis are seeing the rooms. All the rest you can see with the general admission ticket. The place is wonderful and you'll be shooting pictures left and right. We were there when it was sunny, so very colorful. What I want to tell you is to take the early train from Rossio train station. The 8:11 train connects perfectly with the #434 bus (to your right after leaving the station- get a map at the information booth at the station). Even being early (palace opens at 09:45) there were lines due to tour groups, but it wasn't too bad. The palace starts to get massively crowded around 10:30, so be there as early as you can. Visit Tue- Fri, unless you like crowds (museums are closed on Mondays).. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!! You'll easily spend 2 hours here."

Easy to get to it - take the train from Lisbon - earlier the better - then as you get off the train circle over to the bus stop get the all day ticket on the #434 bus (6.90 E) and ride to the Palace,  get the combo ticket to the Moors castle too.  The Place is fun!  The colors are vibrant, the tour was interesting to go through and the views are great.   Get here EARLY - the crowds get thick and it all slows down.  When you do get here pass on the temptation to take lots of pictures right away - get in line and then take the pictures of the outside areas after the tour

You can hop on hop off this bus on it’s special route all day. Note that this is only one of three major routes that you can take.

After the palace we walked down to the Moorish Castle and then into the scenic part of Sintra for lunch and to see the Sintra Palace.  From there it is an easy flat walk back to the train station.

It’s only a 40 minute train trip from Lisbon’s Rossio station but purchasing a ticket wasn’t exactly easy with only one auto ticket machine able to take cash or credit card. The other option was to join a longer line for window assistance. Cost was only 5 euro each so very economical! Once in Sintra, it is a charming village to walk around and see local artisans works at very reasonable prices. We were constantly asked if we wanted a private car tour or tuk tuk up to the castle so we opted for the local bus which charges a worthwhile 6.2 euro each to go up to the castle (5kms ...all uphill). Charge to enter the Castle was 14 euro each but again only one of the 3 machines were working to dispense tickets so it was a lengthy process, Fortunately it being May and not as busy as full on Summer this took around 25 mins. Once we were in, we felt pretty annoyed that there was another transfer bus to take you up to the castle so another lengthy queue and they wanted to charge a further 3 euro so we walked which wasn’t too difficult. Worthwhile visit but the infrastructure around the castle is lacking.

Ticket lines for the train were about a 30 min wait.  My suggestions: Get there as soon as the Palace opens, bring lunch with you, if you get there early you can take the bus or tuk tuk, if not- Then Uber was our lifesaver- we paid 6 euros for 4 of us. If you don't get there early expect the drive up to the palace to be an hour; lines into the palace to be another hour; if you get something in the cafe expect another 30 mins. You do a lot of waiting to get into the Palace and then inside it's just following the people like cattle as they move. Next time, I would skip going in and just do the gardens and outside of the Palace.  The structure and colors of the Palace is what makes it so unique.  My rating reflects how crowded this is, not the Palace. Plan it right and it will be great!"

Too garish. We took a taxi, on a Sunday morning to the entrance. It’s a one way narrow road most of the way up. Immediately, I bought tickets for the bus ride up the hill, from the tourist office on the right. Definitely worth it. Don’t forget to get a map, (in your language) or you’ll waste time and energy going up and down. We purchased tickets for just the gardens, but did enjoy the free access to the many terraces and chapel room in the palace, including the bathrooms, gift shop and cafe. Great views from here. The best part of the day was spent walking the gardens, which make it worth the visit. We exited by the lakes and easily got a tuk-tuk for a fun ride back to town. If you can, spend a night or two in Sintra. When the tourist leave, it’s magical. Be sure to bring cash, the taxi and tuk-tuk did not take credit card.

After having waited in line for 20 mins or so, we entered the grounds and climbed up the steep path to the palace itself. We were then met by another much longer queue that didn’t seem to be moving very quickly, difficult to estimate but probably between 1.30 - 2hr wait. We decided not to join the line and walked around the grounds and terraces instead. The views are spectacular, and the outside of the palace is very striking, but overall it was a slightly frustrating visit. We found the other palaces and gardens in Sintra much more enjoyable.

The building is interesting but not a beauty and with the large number of people inside was like a large Congo line.  It was really frustrating and if we’d known the level of freedom we’d sacrifice going inside I think we’d have opted out.  The views of the valley, the garden, and a lot of the palace’s strange architecture can be seen without joining the queues.  It was fun to try and pick the various architectural styles and religious motifs in the building- there are lots !!  We caught an Uber up to the top for about 10 euro and a tuk tuk down for the same.  There were many drivers outside Pena looking for customers so returning to Sintra was not a problem.  I’d recommend not going on a Monday if possible as it’s a busy day as many Lisbon monuments are apparently closed.  Also if you do go and there’s a long queue outside for touring inside the palace then this would be an indication of how fast you will move inside and you could skip it without missing too much , especially if you have visited some of the other palaces in Sintra.

If you don’t catch the bus and attempt to walk, it will not stop at the bus stops if the bus is full. If you go to the Moorish castle first you can buy a ticket for both castles (which I am assuming must be cheaper) or alternatively buy tickets online to save 10%. There are limited ticket machines to purchase tickets (four outside Pena and one outside Moorish unless you go inside to be served) so the lines get very long. Both castles are extremely busy we visited on a Monday in May and it was crazy! We got the first train from Lisbon to Sintra, had a quick breaky and caught the bus and it was already busy. Don’t get me wrong they are beautiful but just be ready for the crowds!At Pena Palace after a certain time the lines to get inside are really long (go inside first if you are planning to before the lines get out of control). The lines get so long that people then get stuck in the line thinking that is to access even the outside. Skip past the line and walk up to the outside. We didn’t go in as it was just too busy for our liking. But the outside was beautiful and you could even have a coffee and wait for the lines to go down if you really want to go inside. The grounds around the castle are nice too. The duck pond is beautiful with swans, geese and ducks (there is also an entrance / exit down there too - we used the exit to walk to Moorish Castle). In May 2019, there were no animals in the livestock areas it’s a bit of a treck (especially with kids) for nothing much other then trees and flowers. The stables have prices for horse rides but we didn’t see any horses. There is also a bus that can take you around the grounds so you don’t have to walk as far.

The Palace and Gardens are nice, but nothing special. The worst part was on the 434 bus, like many people having to stand, going up hill and being rocked in every direction as the bus lurches, stops, starts, for 40 minutes before it has crawls through the traffic to the top. Do not go unless you are fully mobile, with no back troubles, and are happy to queue standing up hill on cobbles for an hour to see the rooms (which are barely worth it). Down in the town Sintra is also packed with tourists, no spare seats in cafes etc. Overall, an ordeal, and hardly worth the hassle.

However, the fascinating array of design introduced in Pena Palace is juxtaposed in such a striking way... old world, asian influence, portuguese touch, russian influence (I'm sure of it)... It is FASCINATING. Now the line to get IN was not so fascinating. So we walked up around the walls inside the palace and did not go in. Which, I recommend if the line is too long. Don't waste time standing in a line.

The line for the bus was already huge (30 min plus), so we got an uber. It cost €6 for the three of us. A one way bus ticket was €3.90, so an Uber was much better value, quicker and more comfortable than a crowed bus. We pre-bought tickets online so walked straight in through the entrance to the gardens and up to the palace. We were at the palace at about 10am, and the line to get inside was already around 1 hr wait time. By the time we left the line would have been close to a 2-3 hr wait to get inside. THE PROBLEM IS THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF TICKETS SOLD AND YOU DONT PICK AN ENTRY TIME. You can still access the terrace / outside of the palace even on a garden ticket and you’d need to wait at all. The palace is beautiful but the entire system is very poorly organised and doesn’t cater to the mass amounts of tourists visiting. We thought we were prepared by arriving early and getting tickets in advance but we still spent more time waiting than sight-seeing. This attraction needs to limit daily tickets and specify entry times.

You can see Gustavo Eiffel's influence when you look at the bridge but it was not designed or built by him as some people believe but by one of his most talented pupils (Théophile Seyrig).Ponte Dom Luis I divides the city in two different sides. It links Ribeira with Gaia. You will see the river as well as the houses of Ribeira from one side and the O porto wine cellars from another. There is an upper and lower bridge. Both allow pedestrians. You have amazing views from the top of the bridge but definitely it’s not for those with fears of heights. Walking along the top level with the trams passing beside you is a great experience but a little bit scary if you are afraid of heights. For photographer the upper deck is a hotspot, especially in the early morning or evening. For the return you can do like us and take the water taxi across the river.A walk over the Ponte de Dom Luis I is a ""must do"" on a visit to Porto."

Don't believe me?  Then take a stroll over this lovely, steam-punk, Eiffel Tower-inspired design on a sunny warm weekend day. On the Gaia side of the bridge where the old Port Houses are located you will find young men jumping off the lower level. If you remembered your swim suit, then jump in with these bold young Porto residents. Warning: if you a non-swimmer, I wouldn't advise it as the currents can be strong and the boat traffic below is busy on the weekends. A safer alternative is to watch the daredevils from the convenient cliff tops where tourists snap photos and drop euros into the jumper's donation hat that gets passed around after a Jump. As a sightseeing site, the lovely old bridge offers up arguably the best views of Riberia on the north bank and Gaia on the south bank. One last warning:  Keep close to the bridge rail as tour buses' mirrors come very close to knocking off your hat or whatever else should you stray too close to the traffic.Yes....the bridge is Free to walk across.

Much like another reviewer, the low score given is to alert visitors to the scam that is taking place on the upper part of the bridge where the metro runs. A group of young girls (and sometimes a couple of young men) pretend they are deaf and mute and ask for donations for a non-existent charity for the hearing-impaired.My husband and I have been accosted several times and have always refused.  They are very persistent and are bold enough to tap you to get your attention. They will smile and gesture to the clipboard they have and indicate that they are asking for a donation. We know they can hear and talk because we have seen them talking to one another just before they start their fleecing of unsuspecting visitors on the bridge. Once we saw a couple give some money only for the con-artist (a girl) to indicate that the donation should be a minimum of €5. The guy looked surprised and said in English, “Oh, a minimum of €5!” and pulled out a €5 note and gave it to the con-artist. As I passed the guy, I asked him if he knew that this was a scam and he looked at me and shook his head saying, “No English, no English!” I don’t know why he denied being able to speak English when I had clearly heard him say the above statement in English. The last time we were accosted (it was a guy this time) my husband told the con-artist that he had already heard him speak. The con-artist looked shocked and immediately walked away! No surprise there that he had actually heard what my husband had said! I hope this review helps visitors avoid getting ripped-off by these con-artists. There are cameras on the bridge but this scam has been going on for a couple of years now and the authorities haven’t done anything much to end it. It is a shame because the area is really nice and a good experience can become an annoying one when harassed by these people. Be on your guard.

There is also an excellent cafeteria across from it by the museum and a nice park area across the road, and a short walk away is the famous Pasteis shop and buildings with lovely tiled facades.

First of all, it's a masterpiece of Manueline architecture, the Portuguese version of Gothic related to the Age of the Discoveries and its most famous king, Manuel I. In its exterior but especially in its cloisters, you will notice a lot of sculptures and details related to sea voyages (like navigation instruments, exotic plants and animals) Second, this is where Portuguese explorers (like Vasco de Gama) will rest and pray before sailing to all corners of the globe. By the way, you'll find the tombs of many of the most famous Portuguese people like Vasco de Gama, poet Luis de Camoes and of course King Manuel (inside the church), but also the poets Fernando Pessoa and Almeida Garrett. It's a bit like the Portuguese version of Westminster Abbey.Finally, it's situated in the Belém district, where you'll also find the iconic Torre de Belém (make sure to buy the combo ticket), the Monument of Discoveries and just close, the delicious Pastéis de Belém. To reach it, take tram 15 and make sure to arrive at the opening time (10am). Just remember that it's closed Monday (as well as the Torre). But do not miss the Jeronimos at any cost if you are in Lisbon!

Belem is a 20 minute bus ride from the heart of Lisbon and the 728 bus will drop you off right in front of the monastery. There was a mass of people waiting to enter the Santa Maria church, which is free, but if you want to enter the cloister of the monastery, and believe me, you definitely do, you need to head to the next entrance to the west to purchase your ticket, then return to the church entrance, where you will be directed to the cloister. Walking into the sun-bathed cloister courtyard took my breath away. Even though there were quite a few visitors on the Friday morning we were there, they faded from view as the exquisite sun-drenched cloister took all of my attention. What at first seem to be very uniform and repeated patterns on further inspection are revealed to be in fact innumerable variations on themes that would take hours to study in detail. The light and shadow created unforgettable colors and hues that photographs just don't capture accurately. The second level  provided access to the balcony of the church but the church offered darkness and constriction while the cloister offered brilliant light and serenity. There was also a very informative historical exhibit which provided context by showing the history of the monastery, the history of Portugal, and world history in parallel on a timeline. There are also several adjacent galleries that can be visited, but nothing comes close to the perfection of the cloister. Enter, sit down, relax, contemplate, leave refreshed.

No ticket’s needed for the latter. The church is wonderful - with styles from Gothic to Mannerist, via the Manueline, it’s a potted history of Portuguese architecture. But, to my eye, the cloister’s even more beautiful and I would strongly recommend a visit. The dual-level structure is fascinating and unusual and the stone carving, although quite a lot is restoration, is superb.

The church tour (free) really added to the overall experience though. Tickets are sold in a separate building with another museum. They are self-service kiosks with someone there to assist, which leads to a long queue when the card swipe fails and the transaction is cancelled forcing you to re-enter the data over and over (seemed to be a trend with everyone - the pics to assist are misleading).It's worth a stop if you are in Belem, but I'm not sure I'd make a special trip just to go.

They do have lots of helpers there but perhaps they should go back to using those folks to sell the tickets and speed up the process. Of course very crowded in the monastery too. When leaving the monastery, you must then get in the long line again to see the cathedral.....it is free. The cathedral is beautiful but I was shocked at the total disrespect for the silence request!

It's not only a great example of Manueline architecture but also the first (and last) thing navigators will see if they come back or sailing all corners of the globe. If you don't want to wait in a long line, make sure to arrive at the opening time (10am, closed on Monday) and to buy a combo ticket with Jeronimos Monastery (another must-see). Even though the Tower offers great views on Lisbon bay (and a great nesting place for pigeons), I will say that Jeronimos Monastery is more worth of your time if you are in Belém. However, in all cases, do not miss a picture in front of this tower :)

From the top,one can have the bird's eye view of the area including the 25th April bridge & Christ the king afar at Almada.A morning visit before 10am will be the best as especially during the Spring it gets crowded afterwards making long queues to climb up.There are some good restaurants by the river too that one can enjoy a good meal & wine with a good view.

The tram is an air-conditioned, modern one so it was pleasant. Once we got off the tram, walk through the park and through the underpass, once you are the other side, you should get an electric scooter (hundreds around, all different companies, just download an app) and whizz down the seafront to the tower. It is flat and a lot of fun.The queues for the tower itself were ridiculous, even midweek in May and from reading other reviews I suspect not worth it. We spent about half an hour looking from the outside, we found a little patch of shade (although there isn't a lot of it, so wear suncream!). It is a beautiful little tower, and made more beautiful by the blue of the water behind it. There is water around it and people were paddling. There is a little cafe/restaurant and lots of stands if you need water/snacks etc.

Less intimidating due to its easy access, away from the narrow streets and congestion of central Lisbon, it is one of Portugal's most recognizable sites.  Don't be put off by the line to enter the former fortress tower, built in the 16th century. Once you get inside you can appreciate the need to only allow 125 people in at any one time. After about a 45 minute wait, we were able to wander around the various levels at our own pace.From the main terrace, one can easily imagine Portuguese explorers leaving from this point of departure, embarking on adventures into unknown territories.  Pick out the iconic symbols of the armillary spheres and crosses seen throughout Portugal's architecture. It's also interesting to spot other references to navigation, such as the use of rope and knot motifs incorporated into the ornate limestone structure.It is an excellent place to take pictures of the Tagus River and where it enters the Atlantic Ocean. Numerous sailboats glide by the ancient tower, providing that perfect photo opportunity of old versus new, and the tradition of seagoing vessels.Note:  For those who have priviously tried climbing narrow circular stairways in European castles, you know the uncomfortable promise of meeting someone trying to squeeze by, going in the opposite direction.  Belem Tower has one of the most amazing and efficient systems for going from floor to floor.  Lighted timers above the doors indicate when you can go up or down the stairs, switching every three minutes. A warning beep indicates when the three minutes are up, and if you are caught somewhere along the passageway, you slip into the room level closest to you.  While you are waiting, each level of the tower has something interesting to see or information to read, along with places to sit as you catch your breath.

Its situation is wonderful and the views of it from the park are excellent. But to queue for nearly an hour - in full sunshine in 30 degree heat - is a test of endurance and I’m not sure that the interior warrants it. Sure, there are great views out from the tower over Lisbon, but you can get these elsewhere. As with the Pena Palace, there’s an issue of how to manage very popular, but quite small, attractions. I’d really suggest the tourist authorities take a look at how similar attractions elsewhere manage queuing. Timed-tickets seem a possible option. But to finally arrive at the ticket office to be faced with a sign reading “Complaints Book Available” suggests there’s a problem which isn’t being addressed.

We went on a Sunday.  (Closes on Monday and holidays.). We were in line for 20 minutes and next to go in when all of a sudden the “guards” stopped letting everybody in.  No explanation — we just had to wait.  We stood there essentially over the lunch hour with no word or apology.  Finally, a Portuguese  woman went up and asked what had happened.  They had too many people in the tower and just stopped letting people in.  We watched well over 60 people come out during the hour we waited at the head off the line, but they did not even let in the next ten.  It was very aggravating. Then when they finally let us in, the ticket taker would not take charge cards and when we gave him cash wanted exact change, again in a less than friendly manner.  Finally, we were in.  Once in, the tower is beautiful.  They have a timed system so that when the green arrow points up everybody goes up the stairs.  There is a warning sound at the end of about 4 minutes and you are supposed to get out of the stairwell at whatever level you are at, because it is about to change direction, so that everybody goes up at the same time and then down at the same time.  It works well except for those people who ignore the system.  The tower is amazing and worth a visit.  I just hope you do not have to wait for an hour when they overfill it.  Good staffing would get this place a 5 star review.

Then the trail led through a cave to a maze of pathways ending in waterfalls, stepping stones across a stream, and finally to a bridge that took us out of the maze.  We continued down the mountain, past more forests and gardens, and a lovely yellow, red, and gray stone mosaic wall and fountain, until we caught a glimpse of the castle to which we were headed, with its massive stone walls, towers, and spires.  Further down the path, we came upon the lovely chapel with gothic spires on top and baroque decoration within.  At last we arrived at the main house.  The second owner, Monteiro, wanted to recreate the Manueline style in the house and gardens to revive the art and architecture associated with the epic “age of discoveries” and the reign of King Manuel I—the period of greatest splendor and creativity of Portuguese culture.  He definitely succeeded.  The first room we visited was sunny yellow and had the most beautiful white plaster fireplace and ceiling with delicate carving and statues—like icing on a huge wedding cake. Mosaics in lovely pastels—yellow, pink, green, and blue—appeared above and below the fireplace, and even on the floor.  Next, the large hall was paneled with rich, red-brown wood and the walls were dotted with “CM” monograms of the Carvalho/Monteiro family, interlaced with ribbons.  Rooms continued with fanciful pastel-colorful paintings of 18th-century garden scenes in baroque/rococo style and elaborately-carved wooden doors and ceilings, compete with cherubs.  Exploring the castle and grounds was like something out of a Tolkein novel--a magical experience!

We had about a 40 minute wait in line to get tickets and into the gardens, but it was well worth it.  We didn't spend any time really in the buildings but all of it in the gardens which are expansive and makes the place feel uncrowded.  We started by hiking up to the well, Poco Iniciatico.  It was a neat experience to walk around, we didn't realize that if you walked all the way down you could access the other more rustic well, Poco Imperfeito.  Both of these come out to the bottom of the cave/lagoon area Lago da Cascata.  We were short on time while we were here because we were on a tour but it is well worth an afternoon here.  TIP:  Walk to the bottom of the wells and out through the grotto.  Such a neat experience for the kids.

We love the quirky buildings and nooks in the garden. Our 5 year old son really enjoyed exploring the garden too. Would definitely recommend as a good place for young children.There were a few very interesting spots that made the place very memorable for us. For example, the spiral staircase, the stepping stones on one of the ponds and a dark tunnel alongside another pond that was great fun for exploring.The garden turned out to be our highlight for Sintra.

I would describe the garden as a cult playground. An idea verified by the ceremonies conducted in the initiation well combined with Tarot rights and the symbology of the well construction itself in number of steps to landings, and star/pentagrams. Many of the statues, fountains and gargoyles depict a goat’s head. The statues at the base leveI are all from Greek Mythology. I found it odd that such a mysticism place would have a chapel, but the chapel’s secret is that it holds the seal of the all-seeing eye at its entry. The cave at the base of the tower has a chandelier in shape of a hexagram or 6 pointed star. I’m sure the property is riddled with many more I did not have time to explore. Pay attention to detail as there is a lot and it's easily missed. Even small simple things like the fountain in the cafe has a different sea shell in each hand..  Further research shows that the owner Monterio in 1904-1910 built the establishment to house symbols that he took interest and curiosity in which range from Alchemy, Masonry, Knights Templar, and Rosicrucians. I would say Monterio the Millionaire as was his nickname, succeeded in hiding his symbolic ideologies in plain sight amongst the beautiful smokescreen of a peaceful garden with flowers, water features, and architecture that gives birth to excitement and wonderment. Currently I would believe this site still attracts those interested in occult ideals. My private guide explained to me that Madonna herself has seen the gardens; and that she had a 6-month trial purchase of the villa adjacent to the garden. After the 6-month trial period she did not complete the sale, realizing living so close to a tourist location, not to mention UNESCO as a celebrity was probably not the best idea. Madonna is into Kabbala and it’s mysticism, so it’s possible there’s a connection, and a quick internet search does confirm her Lisbon home purchase.   If you visit the gardens do so with plenty of time! I recommend NOT going with a tour group as you’d be surrounded and held up by the groups. The earlier you arrive the better. Large groups of tour busses were arriving as I left and the population inside easily tripled. Even prior to so many buses at the initiation well was the largest haggle of people and que to walk down it’s abbys. Make us of the map given to you at entry. The garden is vast with many levels, steep hills to walk, dark tunnels to explore, towers to climb, and waters to traverse. The point here is to get lost, so guard your soul, and schedule enough time here to find yourself.    Finding parking here is hard. Taking the train or taxi here is more ideal as vehicle parking is scarce, highly observed, and ticketed."

I had heard descriptors like ""masonic"" and ""secret"" to describe the Initiation Well, and I had incorrectly envisioned an ancient place. In fact, the house and gardens were built in the early 1900s, finished about 1910. They were designed by an Italian who was also known for designing sets for the opera in Milan. Hence, the house and gardens are highly romantic and decorative, with hidden staircases, towers and tunnels. It's very beautiful and we enjoyed our visit a lot, although I preferred both the national palace and the Pena palace in Sintra because they have more history than Quinta da Regaleira does. "

The palace was interesting, but the gardens, passageways are unbelievably well made and fun. Make sure your phone has battery - you might need the flashlight!Suggested sintra itinerary (Pena Palace+Quinta da Regaleira): We came to Sintra around 10.30  from Lisbon, directly took the bus up to Pena Palace (so a oneway ticket), visited the palace, took a 40 min walk around the gardens and exited through the 'valley of the lakes', then did a 30-40 min downhill walk through an easy and well marked path below the castelo dos mouros and through the gardens of the villa sasseti to reach quinta de regaleira. Some people were doing this the opposite way (so uphill - no idea why they did that to themselves )From there, after going around the castle, its just 10 mins downhill to sintra where you can also spend some time and a further 5 minutes to the train station.Quinta's coffeeshop is pleasant for a coffee if you find a shady spot:)

It's worth mentioning that this once private estate is located in the hills surrounding Sintra on a narrow road with virtually no parking or stopping.  As we arrived with a guide he drove around while we visited.  Tickets were included with our tour so we didn't have to queue or purchase tickets when we arrived.The house and surrounding park are fascinating - our guide gave us a detailed briefing before we went in (tickets were included in our tour) with explicit directions on where to start, how to walk and what to see which made our visit very efficient and interesting.  Our guide also gave us a detailed summary of the property, the owner, the symbolism (there's a lot) which made the visit much more interesting as well as maps.  As with the park and palace of Pena, there was little signage and less staff.  This is a self-explore type of destination.  Having said that, we felt in many ways it was much more interesting and a more detailed reflection of the history of the property and the owner.  The curation is better and provided us with an understanding of how the property was developed and what the buildings were used for - it was very interesting.We spent two hours here and we kept moving the entire time.  Again there's a lot of walking, hills and exposure to the weather - bring a jacket and a hat and wear comfortable shoes.  Steps can be quite small and steep in some parts of the buildings and slippery in the caves, along the ponds and descending into the 'well' -which was fascinating and well worth seeing if for no other reason than to marvel at the architecture and construction.The Quinta da Regaleira is not included in all tours so check first before you book - you should definitely visit this estate.  With some small improvements (better signage, a bit more curation outside of the main house, etc. this destination would be even better).

Pena is very impressive however Regaleira is a bit quieter, more fun and you can see more. I waited in line for about 15 minutes to buy a ticket, it’s a very fast moving line. It’s €8 from memory. You get to walk down the well and then step across some pebbles on water to get out at the bottom, it’s quite cool. Even the palace is beautiful I think, it’s very gothic but I really love it. Also it’s very close to the train station, a short maybe 20 minute walk up hill, then the grounds themselves aren’t too bad at all to walk around.

The outside looks like a medieval palace with towers, turrets, and arched gateways, painted with bright colors of red and yellow, tempered by lovely shades of gray and cream.  It resembles a fairy castle with both round and square towers and domes, rather than the pointed gothic style.  The park and palace, outstanding examples of Portuguese Romanticism, have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Anticipating crowds, we took a train from Lisbon (free with our Lisbon Card) at 8:10 am, arriving in Sintra at 8:45, then got a city bus pass for the one route we needed, and boarded the bus at 9:15.  Timing was perfect—we arrived just as they were opening the gates at 9:30.  We walked up the hill  through the beautiful forest, rather than waiting in line to take the tram, so we were among the first to enter.  Because of the way the palace was set up, the tour started in the cloister of the ancient monastery, so we made our way around the inner courtyard to see the smaller rooms around the sides (a pantry, dining room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and an office—all looked intimate, cozy, and livable).  We had to walk virtually single-file, so even though not that many people were there, it was still a slow process + guides with groups stopped to narrate and created further problems. I cannot imagine what it would have been like later in the day with larger crowds!  We passed the monastery bell tower turned clock tower and ascended the stairs to the series of small rooms converted from monks’ chambers to a bathroom, colorful bedrooms, sitting rooms, a tea room, and studies for Ferdinand II and his second wife, the Countess of Edla.  All were furnished with beautiful jade and porcelain, carved wooden furniture, and high vaulted ceilings.  We stepped outside on a beautiful large patio/balcony overlooking the front of the palace and the entryway—views were spectacular.  Back inside we passed through a small smoking room with an amazing green and blue Venetian glass chandelier, marble alcoves, and carved wooden windows.  Then we moved into the older section of the palace and a huge greeting hall/waiting room, complete with Moorish servant statues holding chandeliers, and sofas everywhere.  Upstairs again, we found the “stag room,” which resembled a hunting lodge—antlers all around the white, gold-trimmed walls, a beautiful center post with ribs extending outward from it toward the vaulted ceiling, and magnificent, vibrantly-colored stained glass. Finally, we made our way down a very long spiral staircase to the immense kitchen.  It was truly a romantic/ medieval combo castle.  As we exited, we were astounded by the huge lines of people waiting to get in. We hurried to the back patio and on to the chapel, hoping to see it before the crowds overwhelmed us.  It was small, but a lovely gem.  The 1532 altarpiece, in alabaster and black limestone, depicted scenes from the Annunciation, Nativity, Presentation at the Temple, Adoration of the Magi, and Flight to Egypt with the Resurrection in the center.  There were also two magnificent stained-glass windows in vibrant colors.  After taking in the view from the patio, we made our way down the mountain again, passing people lined up at least halfway down—and it was only 11:30.  We loved this palace, and you will too—if you are there at 9:30 when it opens!

I wouldn’t recommend if you do not like hights, as it’s one of the highest points in town.We went in June, so it was quite quiet and we didn’t need to queue for anything.There’s a cute cafe at the top of the palace, where you can eat and admire the views.It can get quite breezy up there, so I would definitely bring a jacket!Other than that, it’s a definite must!

Our 9 and 11 year old daughters enjoyed their time here, they did enjoy the Quinta da Regaleria more but that's because they were able to expend some energy running around the gardens at that stop.  If I was doing a day trip here it would be my first stop.  You could spend two days in Sintra easily.

That is, unless you steep constant inclines and lines. We had a small win by buying tickets online from tiqets half an hour before we went, but that was really the only win for the day. Firstly, our taxi driver had no idea how to get up there since many of the roads are one way or closed to only tuktuks, so it took way too long to get there and cost a fortune. Luckily straight in with our tickets though, as the line was very long. Once inside, they were out of English maps, which trust me.. you need a map for this place. We pushed the pram all the way up to the palace to find the most ridiculous lines. It was the biggest waste of time. it was also nothing breathtaking or very impressive, just a painted castle. we then walked down to the lakes area, if you have a pram and insist on still heading to Pena Palace, I recommend doing it in this order and starting at the main palace then heading down to the lakes last. You can get the tourist bus back down to town after you are done but my oh my what a nightmare. We were not even there during peak season and they couldn't handle the amount of customers waiting. The drivers were rude and impatient. Everyone just stood around and there was no order at all then when a bus pulled up it was like a free for all. It then took FOREVER to get down in to town thanks to traffic, the arguing between bus drivers and customers at every stop and other tourist buses blocking the bus stops. It was a nightmare. So a few important points- Tuktuks can take children OVER 7, do this for sure, up there and back. Its cheaper and faster plus easy to find them everywhere. They are very friendly people.- Start at the palace then walk your way down through the park- Buy your tickets online ahead of arrival- There is food and drink available at the entrance and exit- There are free buses inside the park but the lines for them are generally so long you can't fit on- Lastly, if you want to do the whole park, you really really need like 2 hours MINIMUM. We spent about 1.5 hours and only saw the palace (not even inside) then walked through the gardens to the lakes. We missed 70% of the park because we did not allow enough time.But all in all I really didn't rate it a severely regret not using the time to go toQuinta Da Regaleira or even just walking around Sintra itself and enjoying the town.

You'll see very strange and colorful and beautiful castle with a lot of gorgeous view points around it. Inside the palace is more homely, king and his mistress, later wife actually lived there. Palace has daily 2 pm tours, but you can take audio guide in gift shop, which is very good. When done with palace you can go to park, which is mostly hilly park with few hidden decorations: the cross, pools, small flower garden etc. One of palace terraces is occupied by cafeteria, with tables, chairs, cold drinks and snacks, and another gorgeous view. It is indeed very unusual and beautiful place.

My partner and myself have visited three times in the last 20 years and with each visit it is getting worse!Inside the castle, the rooms are furnished reasonably well but the collections are not overwhelming or stunning and are very museum like.The collection of artifacts are original but are very dusty and are not presented at all well, somewhat slap hazard in display. The interiors are visited everyday by thousands and thousands of people from all over the world and the queues to buy tickets and then access the interiors and gardens are so badly managed by the staff that you have to wait for hours to get in, in queues that stretch for almost a mile and then literally shuffle through, all quite dreadful.In contrast to this place go and visit the fabulous QUELUZ PALACE where the interiors are beautifully presented full of lovely furnishings and collections, amazing interior decoration and pretty gardens. It is far less busy and at times you can enjoy this superior palace unhindered by people in the exquisite interiors. ....Now back to my main issue with both Palaces whose overseas visitors must be in excess of 75% for PENA and 50% for QUELUZ...On arrival at both this week when purchasing our entry we asked for the complimentary guide map in English, to be given a curt shrug at both places and told we have none, only Portugese and Spanish!!!!Now bearing in mind the vast majority of visitors do not speak these languages but can get by in English we found it appalling that the inefficient management are not able to judge visitor numbers and pre-order sufficient guides for what is the majority of non iberian language speaking visitors at either palace.I would like to add at this point that both palaces have received massive grants from the EU and that Britain as a major EU contributor of funds have given both palaces a vast amount of EU money only to find that both palaces have dreadfully failed in their gratitude to this overseas income of funds by not having an updated supply of simple guides for visitors from the UK, USA, Canada, France, Germany, Russia, Italy,Scandanavia, Netherlands, etc etc etc to enjoy!!!!

So he built himself a fairytale castle, and it is a beautiful one. Certainly worth the visit. But, it looks best from a distance. It is best to walk the grounds, see the views but don't spend an hour waiting to get inside and them move at the glacial pace through the rooms. If you want a real historic castle better visit National Palace in Sintra.

Regrettably, no photos of the interior are allowed, even without a flash. The history is interesting, but less so than the national palace in the main town. The palace also feels slightly over-polished for tourism purposes. Still, I was very glad to have gone.

You can get there in 50 minutes by suburban train, for just 1.80 euros. You will visit the national palace in Sintra itself, but from the town you can see Castelo dos Mouros and Pena palace on top of the 2 adjacent hills.You can get there by bus, or, you can walk through the forest. This was the fun part, there are marked paths through something that may look like untouched forest, but it is actually maintained, and some flower beds are planted and watered. The whole walk uphill is fun, it is cool in the forest and from time to time, view opens to show the town and palace below. There are big rocks along the path and occasionally placed stone benches to have a rest. The path splits near the top to Castelo and to Pena palace. I recommend visiting the both. Pena is further away, but once you get there, there are beautiful gardens below the palace, and when you finally get to the top, you are rewarded with a view to something that looks like Disney prop. It is 19th century castle, where several kings lived. The history and rooms are quite interesting, but what makes it interesting is the building itself and the view: from the ocean to the Lisbon!

We arrived 30 minutes prior to the park opening (entrance tickets for the park were included, palace entry purchased on the day separately).  We were the second group to arrive and had a quick entry to the park and enough time to take photos without lots of people around.  As others have mentioned, the park is nice and it's very large (approx 65 acres) - you would need most of a day (or more, depending on how fast you walk) to see most of it (excluding the palace).  The park is very hilly and there is very limited overhead cover - wear very comfortable shoes and hats (there is a lot of direct sunlight).  The views are expansive and depending on the weather you can see back to Lisbon on a clear day.  It can also get very cool so bring a jacket and prepare for wind and fog as the park has it's own micro-climate.What makes this particular attraction challenging are the staff and lack of organisation.  Many have commented on queues and they are not wrong - you could easily spend hours waiting to get into the park or into the palace (or both).  In a number of ways it's more challenging than queuing for rides in Disneyland - no protective awnings overhead, no indication of time remaining as you move along the queue, no indication of price to enter the park or the palace, etc.Tip: Unless you have tickets in advance, buy your tickets at the electronic vending machines just outside the main gates as soon as you arrive - don't wait for  the ticket booths to open as there is no difference in price or access.  You won't want to find out you needed to buy your tickets prior to joining the queue and have to wait again. There is limited signage and word of mouth seems to be the main way to find out what's going on.  Luckily our guide gave us specific instruction where to go, how long it would take and when be be back at the entrance. What is particularly disappointing is the absence of much organisation.  The management should look to the Alhambra in Spain for a good example of how to manage large groups of people.  In short - set timed entries to all attractions and enforce the timing so the queues disappear.  Until this happens it's likely more people will just give up waiting as the queues become longer. As for the staff, it's easy to see that they are frustrated and a bit too self-important (scolding small children for climbing for example).  Also, don't expect much in the way of any customer service. In our case we reached the entrance to the palace first (we're very fast walkers) but the sales woman wouldn't sell us any tickets until all of our party were standing in front of her (one had stopped to use the toilet).  So we waited and watched as she vetted each party to ensure that everyone was present.  What is particularly silly is that you need a paid ticket to enter the park so buying tickets to the palace means you all must have paid to enter.  On the day we visited there were no more maps (in any language) available for the park or palace.  Again, thanks to the clever thinking of our guide, he had managed to get 1 map for each group travelling together on our tour (in Spanish, as that was all that was available).  Luckily he was there a day earlier and saw they were running low so at least we knew where to go and how to get back.  There was no information about when more maps (in any language) might be available.  Might be helpful to print off a map in advance.The same thing in the gift shop - we had wanted to purchase a book about the grounds and palace - unfortunately all they had was Greek and Spanish available - not helpful as we are not proficient in either language.  They also had a nice cookbook and again only in Spanish (obviously the Spanish visitor numbers are not as high as anticipated). Finally the toilets were shocking - amongst the worst we had seen and in particular avoid the toilets just inside the the entrance - more are available near the gift shop in the palace.As for the palace visit - our guide mentioned that there wasn't a particular theme to the curation and that was very accurate - there are lots of objects displayed that were  seemingly random.  Some belonged to the King and Queen, some were from the days when the palace was used by monks.  Some might describe it as eclectic.  Curation is brief but concise - if you can get close enough to read the information in the very small spaces and passages.  It was worth a visit (6.5 euros each) but again, arrive early if you want to move through in any reasonable amount of time.  There are staff everywhere inside the palace but their main role seems to be to ensure you don't take any photos - no photos are allowed inside the palace.  Once we saw the palace, took a few photos outside and walked back to meet our guide we didn't have time to explore more of the park; however, it was a good overview and given the amount of effort to accomplish what we did it was probably enough.  You really don''t need a guide inside the park or palace as the views of the palace and park are the main focus.  Also worth noting that the parking lot is small (crowded) and the streets are narrow if you are driving.  The Pena park and palace were worth a visit once, but we probably won't be returning."

The view of the ocean and the mountains is beautiful from the terrace of the palace and due to the fact that it's a colorful building and has beautiful gates with moorish art, the palace looks attractive from outside, but inside (the rooms) is a huge disappointment.  They make a big deal about this palace as if it's a ""must visit"" while in Portugal, but if you miss visiting inside, you are not missing a whole lot.  Especially if you go there after visiting Royal palace of Madrid and Versaille palace of Paris, Pena palace does not come close."

I didn't go into the palace however if you get there early you don't have to wait very long from what I heard from travellers I met. You can walk to the palace however it is a bit of a hike and you need to do a lot of walking at the actual palace let alone walking there as well. Only do it if you're fit. The park is beautiful, there's so much to walk around. It's just a really lovely place to walk around. I found the park less crowded as it's so spacious so the crowd isn't overwhelming, it's refreshing. Beware the gardens are tropical so it can be quite humid, come prepared. Also wear good walking shoes!

I would recommend you going to see this place, but make sure you get there before 10:30am or after 3:30pm in order to avoid the crowds.

Walking up it honestly looks straight out of a fairytale book. Such bright colours and amazing views over Sintra.The palace is a combination of styles from 3 different rulers which you can see. It is definitely worth the visit BUT only if you do it right. The palace opens at about 9:45am. Get here at 9am even if you have pre-purchased your ticket. By 9:45 there was a massive queue for the pre purchased line. After entering the gate, you can either get a shuttle or walk 10 minutes to the palace. The walk is uphill so a bit strenuous, but I recommend. Once you get up go straight into the inside of the palace, another queue here forms incredibly quickly and if you wait around you’ll end up having to wait an hour. No pictures are allowed inside the palace, but it’s the outside which is most photo worthy anyway. There’s also a very very average cafe, I don’t rate it at all. I spent about 2 hours here and was perfect. If you don’t come early you’ll need at least 3 hours to allow for queues. Also getting there is quite easy, you have a bus option from downtown Sintra which is 3€ per person. I got an Uber up instead, there’s plenty of drivers around and is only 7€ to get up there. Much easier.

We did take the Tuk Tuk down because we thought at that point we deserved it.Expect lines so try and go as early as possible. If you don’t care to see the inside of the palace just buy the €7 ticket as this will give you access to the ground exterior for all the best photos. Make sure to explore the town of Sintra as well tiny cafes, old houses, and beautiful streets! A great day trip!

We found no queues at the Palace entrance where there were many manned ticket offices for cash or machines for cards to pay admission. Once inside, unless you struggle with mobility, ignore the €3 cart to take you up the hill and climb up the path through the pines. If you bought the €14 admission ticket, that also gets you into the Palace building where you can follow the laid out route to see all the beautiful rooms - again no queues, but no photos allowed inside. You can (and must) take lots of photos from the terraces and turrets which give stunning views of all angles - back to Lisbon or out to the sea. Leaving at 1600 there were empty 434 buses queuing up to whisk us back down to the station. A memorable visit.

It was lovely walk with spectacular views of Sintra and it’s various attractions around this UNESCO World Heritage Town. Once I got to the top, I only had an hour to explore the park so I bought a park only ticket for €7.50 (Park and Palace was €14). It was a good thing too because the queue to get into the palace was extremely long for those people who had tickets. I visited between 12:30 and 13:00 and the tourists would have been queuing for a least an hour to get into the palace. No queue to get into the park just a moving queue to purchase your ticket (less than 10 mins). Avoid the queues, go really early or later in the day. You will enjoy the experience more.It’s probably a good thing to point out that the palace is built on a steep hill. Even inside the park, there is lots of up hill walking. There were loads of moaning kids struggling with the climb. There is a bus within the park to take you to the palace from the park entrance but even the bus gets quite packed and where the bus drops you off, there is still lots of steep walking within the immediate palace grounds.Breath taking views and palace.

It’s not overly stunning but it makes you appreciate the architecture and what life was like back in those days.  The palace is easy to walk through and with no crowds you could definitely cover the tour in 30 minutes.  From the front of the palace there is a nice view of the town of Sintra and it’s small, quaint shops.

The tour guides know that you need to get there early and hike up the hill to get in line before everyone else does or you’ll wait for hours. I can’t even imagine how crowded the interior would have been like if we’d waited. There’s only one way through and it’s basically a single file line. I loved the Moorish flair and the decorative tiles and touches. Plus, the views are incredible!My advice? Book a tour and get there early!

I expected much more from this and was quite disappointed. I found architecture of the  palace lacking elegance. The views were nice. It was extremely and I was constantly looking for cover. TONS of people. The park is nice but extremely strenuous to walk around even for someone in good physical shape. Don’t expect views of the castles or city from the park due to tall trees. But not many people in the park, which was nice. We skipped the palace interior and only purchased the park ticket. It gave access to lower terraces of the palace. Couldn’t figure out if we could access upper terraces and there was no one to ask. Food options are poor and overpriced. Wish I skipped this attraction all together and just did the Moorish castle. If you do decide to go - buy tickets online and download them before coming as phone reception and WiFi is sketchy. We drove and found parking just fine, but we came around 9:10 before the park opened. Prepare to walk A LOT - up and down hill. Bring lunch with you if you can.

The castle itself looks like a mish mash of styles and the interior is very underwhelming, lots of small rooms with some amazing tiles and wall decorations and some great views. All in all i have seen many more mesmerising castles.

I decided to visit Sintra as it is well known for palaces and castles. Our first choice was the Pena Palace and the second choice was the Quinta de Regaleira. However, We arrived ar Sintra train station almost 11 am and we had to be back in Lisbon by 4.30 pm.  Thus we had time for only the Pena Palace. The train from Lisbon Rossio train station was packed.  Some travellers had to stand for 40 minutes. The fare (1.80 euro one way) was cheap compare to traspprtation in Sintra. One roundtrip from Sintra station to the Pena Palace was 6.90 Euro with only 2 km but very hilly. The ticket line was pretty long. I wished I should have bought tickets online. After entering the gate, we still have to climb up some hills and waited in line just to get inside to see the interior. However, the outside was magnificent and this, in my opinion, was the uniqueness of this palace.  Since I have been to many luxurious palaces,  the Pena interior was minute comparing to those.  Staying outside the buiding just to enjoy those views was worth visiting this palace

Without it the two sides of Porto would be difficult to see. Long live the water taxi. We walked across the bottom to the Port wineries and enjoyed excellent tastings. We took the gondola to the top and walked back across the top. The perspective of the city is quite different from the two levels. The top seemed safer than the lower level as cars trucks and buses are all within inches of you on the narrow unprotected side path of the lower level. The upper level is for teams and there is plenty of space to walk and avoid them. Taking into account the age and history of this bridge,  I am certain that it has been instrumental in helping Poryo expand.  Well worth a wander.

Built in the delicate, lacy Manueline style, it has a beautiful covered walkway built around a central courtyard and beautifully carved pillars with religious, royal, and natural symbols.  From the cloister, we climbed a staircase which accessed the choir loft of the Santa Maria Church and provided a breathtaking view of the church below, the Gothic rib-vaulted ceiling, and the gilded decorations of the loft itself.  Returning to the cloister, we walked around the square to see the beautiful side rooms, the most magnificent of which was the monastery dining hall with its amazing fan-vaulted ceiling.  A beautiful carved stone “rope” ran along the walls on all sides at chair-rail level and served the border for the most spectacular set of blue and yellow tile panels, each showing a different biblical scene. Admission is 10 Euros (free with a Lisbon card) and definitely worth a visit.

We took an easy train ride to Belem and then bused back. The building is spectacular, especially the cloister. The scale of the entire place is enormous, and apart from standing in line in the heat, it provides cool respite from the sun inside the glorious church. The church itself is free, but the cloister is €10 - totally worth it for the intricate stone carvings - some of the best masonry in Europe. Highly recommend.BONTAKS TRAVELS

When we arrived at the monastery around mid-morning, there were already very long queues forming at the entrance.As the queues were so long and we only had limited time we decided to skip seeing the interior and just make do with enjoying the spectacular architecture of the immense frontage of the main building. The large plaza in front of the monastery was full of people doing the same thing as us. There were also many vendors in the area selling souvenirs, tours, ice-creams and the like.This is certainly a “must see” attraction for any tourist visiting Lisbon. Those wishing to visit the monastery’s interior should either arrive early or be prepared for a long wait.

Be prepared for climbing many steps if you want to get to the top - it's one way traffic as the stairwell is so narrow - a people traffic light flashes when it's time to go and it's on a timer so there's a warning horn that sounds when you need to clear the stairwell for traffic in the other direction. Fortunately there are side exits if you need a break climbing up or need to clear the way for others. We were able to get some great photos at the top - worth the climb.

It would cost very little to provide decent leaflets or signboards which would make such a difference to a visit.

On the lower staircase some of the chapels were closed due to reconstruction so you did not see all the stations of the cross.

The interesting but exhausting way to get to it is down the stairs from the Bishops Palace and Porto Cathedral. On the way down you can see colourful homes nestled along the hill. Some of the house have been converted into rental apartments but the rest remain as authentic Portuguese residences. By and large the cafes along the Cais are not cheap and the food not particularly great...they are good places to have coffee and sangria and enjoy the view and street entertainment. You can also buy cruise and ‘Extreme Jet’ tickets here.

I used  route 434 to visit Mouros and Pena and route 435 for Regaleira and Montserrrate for much less cost.  Regaleira is accessible by a scenic but fairly steep walk from the town centre.

It's not as famous as some of the other palaces in the area, so it's tempting to skip it, but this was our favorite attraction in Sintra. As others have noted, this is a whimsical, mysterious garden full of inverted towers, wells, tunnels, grottos and castle walls. It is unlike any place we've ever visited. The photography opportunities are endless. It is also a wonderful spot for escaping the world with a book or a sketch pad. Children will enjoy exploring the hidden wonders, but it's worth noting that it is easy to slip on the pebbled paths and take a nasty spill down a hill or over a low stone wall. So families with small children should explore the gardens as a group, rather than letting children run off on their own. After a full day of sightseeing, we opted to skip the tour of the Quinta da Regaleira manor house, but the grounds themselves easily justify the admission price.

I had the best octopus salad ever in there !From here (about 3 Hours with a lazy lunch) we climbed up the road/path for a view of the Pena castle and the Moorish castle-all very impressive from a distance-enough in our opinion . We then took a lovely walk downhill from the Moorish Castle ticket office  thro the gardens that lead down to the historic centre  The Palace at the historic centre we also avoided though viewed from outside.  The centre is worth a wander around and the shops and cafes worth a look.This was a good plan for us and worked well-you could do everything, each at 30 E and end up worn out and tired of stately homes , with 2 kids this was just right .BTW take some layers it can get very chilly and misty up on the tops.  Consider a taxi to  sintra and get dropped off at the historic centre, then walk everywhere.  driving looked complete nightmare and driving/taxiing or taking the bus up to the tops was one huge traffic jam best avoided.

You could use the various busses from the station.On arrival the queue was short, we got a ticket easily. Headed into the park with a map and made use of the toilets. There is a cafe here too.We followed the map and headed away from the crowds, this gave us peace and quite, much better as we could stop and look. There are beautiful flowers here, plenty of places to stop and relax. The underground grottoes and walkways are dangerous, for unsupervised  young children. Hold their hands and know where they are. I had a 20 year old, with us and he nearly fell down a hole!  Healthy and safety is not the same as the UK. There are open expenses of algae water, with steps down. Our son stepped onto it and ended up with one wet foot.The well is busy as everyone goes down, taking photos, along the way. Again there is very little health and safety, you can learn right over, should you wish too!!It was busy around the wells, but apart from that freedom to move. Lots of shade, though our first day 1st July was chilly. Plenty of places to sit and a pleasant cafe at the top of the palace steps.Definitely reccomend this as a place to spend several hours.

Arriving at Quinta we queued for around 15 minutes for the ticket office which was okay. We then spend a few hours just wandering about, trying to find all of the main points of interest. Photos do not do the place justice as it is just amazing but it was really busy and it was not yet high season. This is a must visit place.

Its a 5 minute walk and well worth the visit. From there you can walk downhill using the historic centrico path. Its a relatively easy downhill walk (much harder if you opted to walk uphill to Pena palace which I would not have done). Once you are at the bottom you veer left and head to Quinta da Regaleira. Every aspect of this place was amazing and I would take at least a couple hours to wander the gardens. The audio tour was well worth the extra 4 euro.

Over ambitious we had planned to go and see all of them on the same day. This however proved to be completely impossible, for us travelling with kids. We bought tickets, had dinner in a local restaurant, and took a nice walk around the area. The whole valley is such an amazing scenery to explore. Amazingly beautiful mountainsides of steep cliffs, and green trees of great variety. The many artists down the roads selling pictures, ceramics, souvenirs etc. made the walk all the more exiting, especially because the selection of stuff being sold, was surprisingly appealing. We settled on Pena to start with, as it was the biggest one - and jumped on the bus up there. It's pretty high up, and the busses go up and down narrow, winding roads, like clock work. Once we got there it was very beautiful. You could freely walk around the entire palace, and get a nice view out on the valley. However, we came on a bit of a clouded day, and I'm pretty sure the view is all the more amazing without a cloud in sight.The entire trip up and down to the palace took a while, as it was high season in July, and overflowing with tourists. So we had to limit ourselves, to only visiting Pena, for this visit.We could have wished that we had stayed there for a few days, in retrospect, and had been able to go and see the other castles. If you're somewhere not too far from Sintra - go go go!

Make this your first stop in Sintra or arrive much later in the day after some of the crowds have died down. Note that it's about a 45-minute bus ride to the top. Parking for private cars is limited. Tuk tuks cannot take children younger than seven-years-old. We were a group of 6, and could not find one tuk tuk to take all 6 of us at the same time. In addition, it can be very hard to get an Uber up to Pena Palace. The Wi-fi is spotty in the center of town, and most of the Ubers are busy taking other passengers. So come prepared with a transportation game plan if possible.When you arrive at the top of the hill where the palace is located, there will most likely be a queue for tickets. One member of your party can queue while the rest explore the grounds. The trails and parkland surrounding Pena are vast. We wished we had a day just to spend here, visiting the palace and the grounds. If you wish to visit the Moorish Castle, you can walk there from Pena. If you've already seen St. George's castle in Lisbon, you may wish to skip the Moorish Castle, as it's a very similar attraction.There is a cafe, terrace seating, gift shop and restrooms at Pena Palace, so that helps make for a comfortable visit. You are allowed to take as many photos as you wish of the exterior, but interior photography is not permitted, Be sure to bring a sweater/jumper-- Sintra has a microclimate that is much colder and damper than Lisbon. This difference is noticeable at Pena Palace. It can be very chilly and windy at the top, even if it's 20 degrees warmer in Lisbon.

I had the local cuisine, whole fish, I think hake, very good. After that we took took a bus up the remainder of the way due to everyone being full. Pena Palace was really cool and we ended up staying there quite a while taking pics and everyone just went there own way walking around. The kids also said the entire town is on wifi and said it was pretty decent service for the most part.

Great climb with magnificent views, it's a must see. From the Moorish Castle we found a trail that led us all the way to the village of Sintra. It's a very clear and wide path but you do have to make sure that you don't miss it as there are no signs indicating it as the way to the village.

There is an option to visit the terrace without actually entering the palace which is a cheaper option, just as breathtaking and you can get all the instapix you want.

There's also an option to purchase a palace shuttle (3 euros) that takes you up to the palace (recommend it for families with children and individuals with mobility issues)."

Inside the castle was nice, but I would recommend to buy a ticket just for the park, because with that you also can get to the castle, only not inside it.You have to wait long in line. It's also unsafe because there's no limit on the tickets, so there are way to many people there and there are just a few emergency exits. If you visit the castle I would recommend to go in the morning or evening.

Bear in mind that the maps aren't very clear, however, and desperately need to be numbered or organised in a better way.Oh, and make sure to take sensible shoes, because it's pretty steep going up there.

And once you arrive don’t get fooled into waiting with all of the people suckered into the interior route (is included!), as you approach the palace look to the left of them for a separate entrance path, queue-free.

This will save you from lining up to buy tickets.(2) If you’d like to also see the interior, get there early in the day. I arrived shortly after 9:30 am and there was hardly a queue to enter the palace. By 10:30 am, the queue had already snaked to outside the palace entrance.(3) If you only need to see the outside, go later in the day. Sometimes, there is fog in the morning, which ruins the view. Go later in the day when the sun comes out and the fog dissipates.(4) Unless you are physically unable to, skip the green shuttle buses that take you up to the palace entrance. Although uphill, it is a quick ten minute walk up.(5) If there are a few of you going together, consider calling for an Uber. The cost of subway, train, the Scotturb 434 bus all adds up. During the high season, many Uber drivers will take you to Sintra, do local trips while you’re in the palace, and then take you back to Lisbon at the end of the day.(6) Head to the town centre for lunch rather than eating in the palace. More options and better food.

I wish they would charge more and limit the attendance so you can really take time to experience the beauty of the property. I’d also recommend paying the $3 for the bus to the top if you are on a tight timeframe.

But unlike this lower elevation structure with a sprawling garden with stunning outposts, the Parque e palacio da Peno was more than an hour away by foot and 15 euros by tuktuk taxi or bus. We ended up taking the bus which saved us on the return and brought us directly to the train station.I wasn’t as impressed as this castle as I had anticipated. Fortunately, we correctly chose the garden only option which meant we didn’t have to wait (30-60 minutes per Cherry Wonderdog estimates) in a long, winding line, completely exposed to the harsh elements, in order to enter the castle. Who knows how impressive the interior was, but I highly doubt it was worth the wait.The gardens were second class compared to those at Quinta da Regaleira, and the directions were poorly marked which meant a long uphill trek at the end to reach the bus stop. Yes, it wasn’t the castle’s fault that it was so foggy that parts of the structure were hidden even close up, but given the weather, the crowds, the lines, and the high prices, this is one castle I would probably skip.

It takes about 45 minutes and costs you less than 30 euro. Make sure you arrive before 930 if you want to see inside the castle. Personally I really enjoyed this tour. It was however so cloudy that we could not see anything further than 20 meters. When we went out of the castle at around 11.00 there was such a queue. To see the inside must have taken them 2-3 hours before they could enter. As you read in other reviews here then better skip inside and take you pictures on the palace ground. Parc is beaitifull but I found it difficult to navigate to the exit.

You have to pay to enter but to be honest it’s a bit of a waste to come all the way here walk up a mini mountain then balk at the fee. 5 of us went in but only had to pay for a family ticket which was €49 . There are quite a few places to eat and buy drinks bout O/S and in the Palace and it’s gardens. Obviously it’s far more expensive inside but they have a cafe and restaurant at the top. On the way as you look up you can see the Palace and it does look like in my opinion at first sight like the quintessential Disney Castle!! Then you have to realise that this Palace at the top of the Mountain is only a few hundred years old! You can see where Disney got its idea of a fairytale castle from. The architecture is amazing. To think originally the mode of transport was horse and cart. It was lovely to see how they managed to incorporate the many defensive castle designs murder holes are still visible, enclosed Tunnel cut in a curve,  as well as keeping the Moors influences on the palace rather then defacing them. There were some absolutely amazing features however they were not being highlighted or used such as what appeared to be a contemplative inner fountain with the water pouring from the Gargoyles above into a central basin with the enclosed square. Probably because of the water damage it may cause to the walls and exhibits. On that note many of the items and exhibits looked tired and placed on display without any great love for them. Plus when you buy the tickets before hand make sure you get entry to the castle interior included ! Saw quite a few people queuing up to enter then being turned away as they only had tickets to the grounds and not the interior. The restaurant, cafe and gift shop are near the entrance to the interior. When you leave take the path to the lakes then to the main road , cross it and take the country trail to Sintra rather then walking along the road

We started off on the gardens and spent, hours wandering around. Not the best sign posted place I have been too. Pleasant to walk in though. We left it until 5pm to view the Palace and by the the queues had died down. As many of the other reviews, you are not encouraged to stop for long and cannot take photos inside. Staff were ok, but it is more pack them in style. Not the best tourist attraction. Lack of cafe facilities available.  One at the start and sign post with a cup to indicate more are available, actually means it's a vending machine available. Not great when you want to sit with a good coffee and cake. We did find one in the palace, restraunt on level 1 and cafe on 2. Very pricey, busy and ridiculously expensive. We paid €15 for two rolls  crisps, two cold drinks and a water. London prices.

You need to arrive much earlier to enjoy it fully, and if possible plan to go on the sunniest day of your trip. The clouds somewhat spoil the view and make it a little chilly at that height otherwise.I’d also advise to wear comfortable shoes with grip - it’s a lot of walking, hills and steps so you’ll struggle otherwise.

The grounds of the Pena Castle are unbelievably beautiful. We read reviews to follow advice of only seeing the Parque and not going in the castle, when we saw the line we understood why. Walking around the park and outside the palace was beautiful. We parked in Sintra( which is a challenging and stressful task) and took the bus right from the center up the hill. I was told it would be an hour or more walking uphill. I believe we paid €6 each for round trip on the bus that stops at the Moorish Castle and Pena Palace and brings you back down. When you arrive at the entrance to Pena it is still a short walk uphill to see the palace, I wouldn’t bring a stroller. The palace offered views and fantastic picture spots.

When we got up, the palace was of course really beautiful, with amazing views (see pictures), but when we wanted to get ínside the palace itself, the waiting line was sooooo long and it was sooo crowded that we decided to leave. My suggestion for the organisation of the palace is: please work with time schedules (like the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain). Make sure that people buy tickets for a special time arrangement. Only at that time people can enter the park/palace, and otherwise people just can’t go inside. With this way you manage all the people who come to the palace a lot better. How it’s managed right now doesn’t work. It’s waaaaay to crowded😵 Don’t know if it’s different on other weekdays or times, but we found it not worth the money we paid for it.

The gardens surrounding which you have to walk through are also gorgeous.The only pointer I would say is that getting to the palace is so difficult. Even with prior research we ended up in the completely wrong area, unaware that you can only access it via a car, bus etc rather than walking. We had to end up getting a taxi which cost €5 but this was so worth it as it saved our day!!! Coming down I recommend taking a taxi or tuktuk down too as they only cost €5 per person and will drop you either at the train station or city centre - I wouldn't get the bus as this is hugely overpriced and not very regular.

Then we stood in line to buy tickets for the Palace, then another line to enter the Palace itself. We didn’t make it inside the Palace - we gave up after 30 minutes, when we realized that we were still about 1.5 hours away from gaining entry. So we just wandered the grounds, then went downhill to the lower square and had a very late lunch. The moral here is to razor-focused on getting to Sintra early, and being steadfast in your determination to be one of the first few people there. And Good Luck!

Views from the top part of the bridge are very good. Note that you will have to plan how to approach the bridge depending on whether you want to cross the top or bottom. And, getting to the top or bottom from the opposite part will require a lot of walking, which will be annoying if it is hot! The bottom part is neat to look at, and you might be entertained by the local urchins jumping 30-40 feet into the river.

Many people were walking across and bicycles could sometimes be a bit unnerving as some were not overly careful of sharing the bridge with the walkers. Just pay attention. The train also takes this upper area of the bridge and if you're afraid of heights and think you can walk just a few feet away from the railing you will actually be walking along a narrow opening where you can see below. My sister managed it by keeping her eyes up and on the horizon and she is fearful of heights. We walked it again a few days later to go across to the market.

If you want to visit Belem, then I’d suggest to make the monastry and the local patisserie (it’s supposed to be the pasteleria where the pastel de nata’s were first made) the main reason to go there. At least that’s an actual treat for ones senses.

The gardens in this Quinta are truely remarkable as well as the architectural pieces throughout. Even though there are a lot of people coming, as it is quite big, they spread out quite a bit. Only the wells, the towers, the waterfall and the palace get a bit packed at times. We recommend investing 3 euros on the rental audio guides, which gives you the chance to learn some more about what you’re seeing. The palace is also a fine representation of the amazing art located here; only a shame that the upper floors are not open for visits. You can bring your own snacks and take a pause on one of the many benches around the place to extend your visit some more. The gift shop is very small and lacks a wide offering but you can go down in the old town, just 5-10 minutes from the quinta and find plenty of souvenir and gift options."

We only walked the grounds, not being interested in another building tour.  The grounds were designed/laid out by a genius.  Paths darting left and right, up and down, twisting and turning through acres of land.  Lushly landscaped with hidden alcoves and surprises along the way.  Highlights were the wells.  Spiraling staircases leading deep into the earth leading from one to the other and ending up at a waterfall with stepping stones crossing the water.It was a delightful few hours discovering what lay around the next corner. Well worth your time to visit when in Sintra!!!

The former owner charismatic millionaire Antonio Monteiro was interested in mythology, mysticism, alchemy and is believed to be a Freemason, so there are a lot of symbols around the park. I am sure you will find much more information about this place from tour guides, I just want to say that it's definitely worth seeing. Enjoy!

Its creator and owner was interested in alchemy, magic, freemasonry so the various sites inside the park are supposed to recall symbols and meanings from ermetic universe. But in the end the better things you can see here are the trees and the bushes, the gardens and the woods. Funny but nothing you will regret if you have to skip the visit. The entrance is 8 euro per person (12 with audioguide). My personal vote is 6 on a 1-10 scale.

Some tips first: buy tickets online, and show them on your phone (no need to print). We only visited the Quinta that day and having one grandparent who could not walk too much we drove to the Quinta. Once there we didn’t find parking as there is none. We continue the road and after a while it widens and people mark on the side. It was 15min relatively easy walk back to the gate. I wish we would have taken the audio guide (3 eur extra) as you are given a map of the garden with the main sites but there isn’t any explanation on it. We started with the gardens, from bottom to top and then back down. Important to note you can only walk down the well and not upwards so it is best to walk down the well and then through the tunnels rather than go through the tunnels first. Also the tunnels are easy walk, relatively well lit. It wasn’t a problem for our grandma. The gardens however are all on a hill so that can be harder. The house itself is relatively small and we could only visit the ground floor at this time due to restauration work. On site there is a cafe which serves some sandwiches, salads, soup, dish of day, hot drinks, ice creams etc. It is quite dear at 8eur a small sandwich or salad. There are also two toilets and be prepared to queue. Finally there is an app which makes the visit a little more interactive, but it’s better to not only download it when connected to WiFi but also download the itineraries.

Thank goodness, because the place was shrouded in mist from the time we arrived until we left. It's a World Heritage Site, and deservedly so (from what I could see of it), but that meant it was packed with visitors. I'm not good with crowds and long queues (it would have been more than an hour and a half to get inside the castle itself) so we opted to explore the park outside. The park was beautiful, and the mist simply enhanced the other-worldliness of it. There were waterfowl and fish galore, and the latter came when called, which was fun (even though I called them in English). Loads of ferns and other greenery, so the rainforest aspect was well played. I particularly enjoyed the mini castle-shaped follies here and there.Eventually we made our way to the top of the hill, to the castle entrance, but the queue was no shorter so we climbed as much as we were able on the outside of the building, which was a surprisingly large area. The building is large and brightly coloured, unlike castles in other parts of the world, and lots of it has the typical Portuguese tiles on the outside, which I am ridiculously impressed by.  I enjoyed my visit, and didn't really mind not going inside - I prefer garden visiting anyway - and my friend told me it's always misty up there, which is at odds with the photos you see online. Go there anyway. It's possibly unique in any kind of weather.

Besides the impressive palace, the view is breathtaking and the surrounding park is very nice.► Important to know before you go:1. My advise is not to arrive with a private car. The parking is very limited.2. If you want to enter the palace, come early. We arrived around 9:45. The line to the tickets and the park was short; the line to the palace's interior was longer (20 minutes). When we left, the line to the palace was extremely long!3.

I recommend hiking up to the palace and skip the €3 shuttle that gets mobbed. Ecclectic design nice views be careful not to fall off the ramparts.

We were never sure of where we were. We went to the moorish castle first and I’m glad we did.  From the moorish castle, walk up hill to the entrance to Pena.

Get tickets online!  Avoid Mondays!  Take an Uber.We got tickets for the train from Rossio to Sintra on Monday afternoon.  10 Euros total for 2 people, round trip.  We caught the 7:40 train out of Rossio on Tuesday morning.  Got to Sintra station at 8:20. Ate breakfast and coffee across the street from the train station.  Called at Uber at 8:40 to take us up to Pena.  It took about 20 minutes.  We bought our tickets to Pena and Moorish Castle online and I had them on my phone.  We were about the 25th person in line to go into the gardens.  We went in at 9 am and walked up to the castle.  We did not wait for the bus.  It is hilly and some stairs.  When we got to the castle we went right to the line to go inside the castle.  We were number 15 to get in.  It opened at 9:30 and we walked right in.  No rush, we took our time through the castle.  No pictures inside but I was able to take them last February when I visited.  Might be a seasonal thing or a new policy.  After we walked through the inside we took a lot pictures outside and on the walls. Well organized and easy.  After we left and walked through the gardens down to the pools.  Lovely.  We left the gardens and walked over to the Morrish Castle entrance.  About a 10 minute walk up hill.  We went into the Morrish castle, again I bought the tickets online and hiked along the walls.  Fantastic pictures.  A bit windy and cool so dress appropriately.  A lot of hills and stairs.  We left the castle and followed the signs down to Sintra.  We were done by 1:30 PM.  Easy....have fun and it is definitely worth it!  We caught the 4:40 train back...bring a snack if you can.  There is food and cafe's but they get busy.

The parks surrounding the Regaleira and the Montserrat are far more interesting. The palace itself, while really pretty from the outside, is really unspectacular from the inside. If you really want to visit the palace, make sure you arrive early. We were there at 9.45 and had to wait no more than 10 minutes. You cannot move freely inside the palace, so there is not much time to stroll around (you are not allowed to take pictures). When we left at around 10.30 the queue was already enormously long. So do yourself the favour and get up early - or skip Pena Palace altogether.

From the inside, it's not much different than other royal palaces around Europe.  The problem is that it takes roughly 40 minutes from Lisbon.  And we then spent one hour in a bus in traffic climbing the hill.  (Single lane road.)  We had bought our tickets on line so there was no wait to buy tickets, but we had to wait for an hour just to enter the palace.  And then once, inside, it's a single file lane though most of the palace so it takes quite a long time to just get through the place.  In my opinion (and my family's) it was just not worth the time.  I'd visit Sintra and see the other palaces and sites.  I'd avoid the Pena and the Moorish castle to avoid the long lines and the traffic to the top of the town..

We avoided the large queue for the palace but find out that if you go into the café you can go upstairs and walk the walls which is well worth it (although a bit scary if you have young children as the walls are low!).We didn't stay too long: it was just too busy for it to be that enjoyable.

The glasshouses would be poor in a garden centre. The rabbit warren had a couple of old sheep and three horses. The gardens were a state. The fences were broken everywhere and the valley of the lakes was three small ponds. The countesses cottage was well restored and looked like it should be from a fairy tale but had little else.I can't comment on the inside of Pena Palace as the queues were between 2 and 3 hours long but you can walk up the outside of the queue to go to the walls and Chapel at the top.Based on the amount of money they are making improvements should be simple by allocating time slots to people to go to the Palace. Also who knows if anything is spent on the garden as it dosnet look like it.Won't be going again.

Our guide was able to talk to a staff member so we were able to skip the line and go straight in. The inside of the monastery and the palace are interesting but not stunning; perhaps we are biased having seen the palaces in St. Petersburg a year ago. The problem with this place is the organization. It can not cope with the huge numbers which come every day. The entry gate is downhill from the actual palace. It is a 15-20 minute uphill walk to the palace entrance. There is a shuttle which costs extra, and you may have to wait 30-40 minutes for this. Then there is a lineup at the palace entrance, which by 9.30 am may be well over an hour long in the hot sun. Then you shuffle through the palace. No photography is allowed inside. Backpacks have to be carried on your chest, not your back while you are inside. There was no indication in the lineup of how long it would be until you reached the entrance.  Also, once you have paid the entrance fee at the bottom, and perhaps have decided that it is not worth the wait, there are no refunds. The key to this place is: arrive at 8am to be one of the first in line. Or come late in the afternoon. Do not bring small children. It is not suitable for them and the whole family will suffer with the long lines in the sun and the kids will hate it. Or just pay to see the outside of the building which reminded me of some of the casinos in Las Vegas— totally over the top. "

After arriving at the train station and waited with the long cues to get out of the station we took bus 434 to go to the Palace. There where many buses but all of them where packed with many people standing, so it was not a pleasure ride.We pre-booked tickets online which are a bit cheaper so we didn't have to wait at the main entrance to get in the Park, but unfortunately there was a long cue for the Palace Entrance. If we hadn't pre booked the Palace Entrance we wouldn't bother waiting to get in the Palace.With the Park ticket only you can see much of the Palace (just not the inside) and you don't have to spent your precious time waiting to get in the Palace.The inside of the Palace is nice and there is a viewpoint up high that you cannot go with only the Park entrance ticket but i don't think it worth to wait such a long time.Keep in mind that you cannot take photos or videos of the inside of the Palace.Pena Palace and Park is a must do when in Sintra but if you don't want to wait the long cue to get in the Palace my advice is just buy the Park ticket and enjoy the beautiful exterior of the Palace.

It also offers a nice hiking route to the Cruz Alta (High Cross), the only place inside the Park that allows you to take some nice shots of the Palace.Queues to enter the Palace are long. After 10:00 it is a really overcrowded place. Best get tickets from the internet beforehand. Anyway, when you're about to enter the Palace you see a big sign saying that photos are not allowed inside the Palace. The ticket is overpriced and with photos not allowed I would choose not to pay this ticket or enter. The worst thing is inside the Palace, it's a bit run-down, you have to follow the queue of people and there is personnel in almost every room worth something to enforce the no photos rule. It's a disgrace.

A 10 minute walk uphill through the forest put us about 20th in line to go inside when the doors opened at 945. The self guided tour takes about an hour. No photos are allowed inside, but plenty of opportunities for photos on the various balconies. When we departed the castle, after a quick snack at the restaurant, it was 1130 and the line wound down the hill, in the hot sun, like something you would see at Disneyworld. It was probably a 1+ hour wait for these poor souls. According to the park, lines are worse between 11am and 1 pm. If you arrive at this time, remember the park and castle are open until 7 pm in summer, so wander around the beautiful park  before attempting the castle tour. The park includes amazing, sometimes hidden overlooks, gardens and pools, well worth taking a romantic stroll.(Will add photos soon)

Pena Palace was like walking back into history with a bit of Disneyland thrown in. Our tour guide John, was well versed in its history and stories which added a lot to the tour.  He strongly suggested that we start out early which I was not for, but so glad we listened to him. The line when we left was several hours long and would have made it so that the Palace was all that we would have seen in the day. My descriptions of the Palace would be inadequate, you must see it to understand it and it’s story. Then on to Sintra. Our guide grew up in the area and the bits and pieces that he added made the tour all the more personal and interesting. The garden was amazing for its diversity and size. It is a picturesque little town. You need to decide for yourself which view is more spectacular. The shop that created the local pastry pillows was great. Cacais was interesting as a view into how Portuguese live and relax. The “fishing village “ is beautiful and the food was great. The drive along the coast back into Lisbon was beautifuland closed out a great day. João really made the whole day and tour, get him as your guide if you can.

The only additional suggestion I would give is to take a tuk tuk from Sintra station as its much faster, affordable (bargain with the driver though),and more scenic as a route. Majorly you skip heavy queues for the bus 434 and hop on hop off’s. The tuk tuk driver also gives out some interesting facts or suggests places to visit.

We arrived at 9:20am, parked in carpark right by the Lake entrance to the park. So no need for tuc tucs, waiting in lines for transfer buses and walking up steep slopes perilously near cars. We purchased tickets online for €7.50, deciding against visiting the inside of castle having been put off by tales of queues. We walked straight in. Wearing sensible shoes we walked quickly up to the castle terraces where we took lots of lovely photos of, let’s face it,  the most interesting & glorious views of the outside of the palace. We enjoyed a coffee, unrushed, outside before making our way down into the garden. By this time (10:30) the lines to get into the castle were snaking all the way up and in the hot sunshine with only a little shade, I imagine the experience was very unpleasant. Instead we walked through the beautiful gardens, mostly people free, & up to the High Cross where even more splendid views were to be taken. The gardens are lovely and shady, there’s lots of views of Pena and it’s all a lot more civilised than most of the horror stories we’d read. Getting ‘down’ after the car park into Sintra was a little hair-raising (nothing that google maps couldn’t assist with) but we had completed our visit and by 13:30 were back in Azenhas do Mah enjoying lunch in the sunshine by the beach. Like most things in life, a bit of ‘organisation’ and thought means you can make the most of every opportunity so don’t be put off! It’s definitely worth a visit!

Turn right when you exit the Sintra Train station and go straight to the bus stand to take bus 434. You can buy ticket on the bus for €6.9 round trip. Do not attempt to walk to the Palace/ Park. It will cost you a lot of time and energy (believe me you’ll need yr energy!) 2. I went straight to the Pena Palace and Park, which is the last destination of bus 434. 3. Buy your entry tickets online at the official website. Tips: don’t have to go and see the interior of the palace. I went at 10.15am and the queue is horrible! Plus you can get the amazing views from the terrace and wall walk (which does not require extra admission ticket).  4. After visiting the palace, take your time to walk  around in the park which is MASSIVE. I went to see the High Cross- personally think it’s alright (okay to miss this). But the Valley of Lake is something else!! So beautiful.  5. Then I walk to the Moorish Castle where you have to hike uphill. It was tiring but the view is SO worth it. And it’s not as bad as I thought it is (thanks to the reviews on TA). 6. Then I took bus 434 back to the city centre of Sintra. So many cute alleys and shops worth strolling around.

If you are going to attempt to drive here, you must get there no later than 8.45am...any later and it’s pandemonium. We parked in the tiny car park next to the palace no problem (which is free). Bought open day tickets online the day before (€14 each). Pretty much at the front of the queue. It opens at 9am, with the palace opening at 9.30am. You can buy bus ticket for €3 to get you to the top, else it’s a fair hike for those bunions. The palace is breathtaking. Inside and out. The park that surrounds it is well worth a wander too. Plenty to see. Comfy shoes are advisable, as I didn’t think and I wore flip flops (huge deal breaker). I won’t say too much more as my words won’t do it justice, just go and see for yourselves.

We took the 40 minute train from Lisbon to Sintra. Immediately upon disembarking from the train we realized that this was a mistake; it was a madhouse to get tickets for any bus leading up to the palace. We eventually bought tickets for the Hop On/Hop Off bus - for our family of 4 we paid 70 Euros - and it was the most expensive bus ride I’ve ever taken! The bus up took 70 minutes due to high traffic. By the time we reached the palace the lines were so long you could not tell where they started and we gave up. I do not recommend doing this in August, maybe it is better at other times of year? BTW, we never got to ride the bus down due to crowds and had to walk instead!!"

If you do not plan on getting there early, then plan to spend your day waiting in lines. We made the mistake of driving up to the palace - forget this, and park in the historic center or near the train station. You can take the bus which is about 6 euros round trip, we took a tuktuk which was able to skirt some of the traffic on the way back up, and the driver filled us on in some much needed information (we were charged 5euro a person one way, as we planned to walk back down). It’s only a steep one way road up to the palace and a one way road back down. You definitely don’t want to walk up, but going down on foot is manageable, albeit steep, and about 30-40 minutes from the palace to the center on a relatively well marked and quiet trail which goes by the moorish castle/fortress. The palace itself entailed another long line to enter. It was a Friday morning in August, so the height of tourist season, with lines to rival Disney world. The palace was the home of the royal family at the turn of the 19th century - it’s an interesting mix of regalia on the cusp of modernity. There are a lot of rooms and artifacts to see once you get inside, behind glass and barriers of course, and decent placards with descriptions (we didn’t get the audio tours or anything). You are not allowed to take pictures in the interiors, nor can you roam free - once inside you are herded along a one way circuit through the rooms. After having wasted so much time waiting, we were too tired to see any of the other sites Sintra has to offer, which is rather a shame, and you have to pay for entry into each site regardless. So be prepared for a long and expensive day, and do your research.

Between the rain & fog, the visability was so bad. Even if it had been a nice day, bus fare + $15€ to see the castle and the tour wasn't worth it in my book. It took almost an hour just to get to the castle which was a sketchy ride on the 434 bus. We then waited in line in the rain for an hour for a tour of the castle and you cannot take pictures. Once we were instead, another line to even get through the tour which wasn't worth it at all. I wish we had stayed in Lisbon and toured the city more - If you're only going for the IG pic, don't waste your time!!! We took the 434 bus up and an Uber down.

The doors to Pena palace closes at 6:30pm. It will take about 10-15min walk from the bottom entrance to the palace door steps. When we arrived, it was already 6:20pm, so took us another 15mins to walk up there, but the door was already closed. The outside is pretty nice as well. You are able to walk around the balcony portion of the palace. it was quite windy when we were there. If you are taking the bus#434 straight off of the train station, the first stop would be Sintra Palace, then Castle of Moors, then Pena Palace. The bus is pretty frequent, it does get crowded, but people do get off and on. 1 Bus ticket will allow you to get on and off multiple times. Overall, The outside was pretty nice and the decor was excellent. I didn't get a chance to go inside, but I am going to assume its pretty similar to Sintra Palace. Since I purchased tickets at the train station for all 3 attractions, I had to make best of what we had. We did leave a bit later from Lisbon. If we were to leave an hour and a half earlier, we would have been able to tour properly all 3 areas.I would recommend for you to come here.

We took the 8:11 am train from Rossio Station and arrived at the last stop (Sintra) around 8:50 am. We then took a Tuk Tuk to Palace of Pena. The tuk tuk asked for 10€ per person for a total of 30€. We talked him down to 20€. Looking back I would have taken an Uber if I could do it again. I looked at the pricing when we arrived and it was around 6€ to 8€ for an Uber from the train station to Palace of Pena.We arrived at Palace of Pena around 9:20 am, 10 minutes before it opened and they were already letting people in. We decided to do the Palace of Pena first because I heard you need to do it early before it got busy. We took the short walk from the entrance to the Palace and visited the inside of the palace first. When we arrived there was no line and I’d say it was worth it to visit the inside. I’ve heard the line in the afternoon can get pretty long so I’m not sure if I’d visit the inside if the line was say an hour wait. We then walked around the palace and then decided to visit the park area of the palace. It’s huge, like it would take you hours to try and see it all. We decided to just visit the Valley of the Lakes, worth it.We ended up at the Gatekeeper’s House entrance just down the hill from the palace. We then walked about 5 minutes up the road to the entrance of the Moorish Castle. You’ll know you’ve arrived when you see the glass house. After seeing the Moorish Castle we walked down the “Pedestrain Route” from the Moosish Castle back to town. You can get a map of the Pedestrian route from either place which shows you the trail. It basically starts the Moorish Castle. There’s a trail head just left of the entrance. It’ll take you about 30 minutes to walk it and it’s a beautiful trail and steep in some parts. We encountered a few people walking up the trail, not sure if I’d try that. Would rather pay the 8€ for the Uber ride to the top. After we arrived in town we got something to eat and then took a short flat walk 10 minute walk to Quinta da Regaleira.

The palace looks beautiful and like something from a Disney movie. However we did not find the interior worthy from all the waiting in line and the terrace around the castle was so overcrowded that it was hard to enjoy.Before visiting the palace itself, we went through the garden (which is worth your time and money) and hiked to the high cross viewing point. From here you get a nice view of the palace and the surrounding area.The palace is definetly most beautiful from a distance.

After you get into the park, go up the hill (or pay €3 to take the shuttle if you prefer; it takes almost the same amount of time).6. Now, you are in front of the palace. It’s tempting to take pics but don’t stop. You have plenty of time afterwards to do it. Keep walking until you reach the line for going inside the palace. I would be honest and say that the inside of the palace isn’t exciting. And you literally follow a line to walk through the palace. No photo is allowed inside. But if you follow the above you will be able to get in rather quickly so you might as well just take a look. Afterwards, you come outside and enjoy your picture time when the huge queue is formed!"

The 3 of us took the 8am train from Lisbon on Sunday morning, then took an Uber to the palace (cost 5.5€ up, 3.5€ down) which was SO worth it because we didn’t wait more than 2 mins for the Uber both ways and we even saved money vs paying 6.7€ per person for the bus which also had a long queue and didn’t even start until 9:15am.  We had to wait in line for palace tickets - the kiosks only took chip and pin credit cards that unfortunately we don’t have on our American cards.  But thankfully the line was nonexistent that time of the morning. No lines at all to get into the palace too, which was great!  There was early morning fog that that burned off very quickly, and the lines for the palace were crazy long by the time we left, so definitely get there early.  We didn’t pay for the park shuttle, which also would have required another queue, so wear your sneakers and do the hike/climb, which probably 90% of the visitors did.  We also climbed after to the cross (again, sneakers highly recommended), it was a nice way to explore the grounds afterwards.By the way, because of how early we went, the Uber ride was no more than 10-15 mins both ways, vs the tour books all hint that the ride could take 30+ mins each way due to congestion.  And it’s a fun ride (perfect for teens), with treacherously narrow streets, sharp curves and crazy steep roads that made us grateful that we didn’t try to hike it up to the palace.  And when we caught the noon train back to Lisbon, the train station was a complete mob scene, it was like swimming upstream, we almost missed our train due to the ridiculously massive crowds exiting the station, not sure how the tiny town and tiny one lane roads of Sintra is able to accommodate that many people going up to the palace.  My guess is that people taking the bus up at that time had to wait a ridiculous amount of time to even get onto a bus, just to add to their waiting misery. So bottom line, go early and you won’t be disappointed!

This Romanticist castle is located in the countryside, high up a hill near the small town of Sintra. If travelling from Lisbon you will need to get a train out to Sintra, and then a bus to a point of the hill that lets you make a walk to both Pena Palace and the Moorish Castle. 'A Walk' is no exaggeration. A full blown hike is probably a more accurate description! There are shuttle buses to and from Pena palace once you pay in, but by this point I was fully committed and took the walk. It was thankfully a nice day, and that high up the air is relatively cool. Once you do reach the Palace itself, you'll find a wonderful, almost fairytale structure painted in impossibley bright primary colours that just aid the cartoon aesthetic. This isn't to say the architecture isn't impressive in its own right, but the colours just make it stand out that bit more. As you explore the castle's many walkways you'll find yourself treated to some spectacular views of the hillside and surrounding area. There is a small gift shop and cafe, and also a minimal inner section, you can pay for entry to, although this can easily be skipped. The walkways and courtyards, all variety of shapes and sizes, are the real attraction here! If going out to Sintra I'd say it's almost impossible NOT to go see the Palace. I'd heartily recommend it, just take your walking shoes or get the bus!

Attenzione ai biglietti famiglia With my family (2 kids of 11 and 14 years old, and my wife) we visited the wonderful Mosteiro Dos Jeronimos, on Thursday 15th August 2019 at 3 pm.The lady at the reception said that we cannot buy the ticket family because my youngest kid is younger than 13 and the rule is that the family ticket is ONLY and when you have exactly 2 kids between 13 and 17 years old. I complained and she insisted that this is the rule showing me what is written on the ticket machine. I politely told her that she is interpreting what is written on the computer of the machine in the wrong way and I asked her to show me the official rule but she rudely denied. So I could not buy the family ticket and I was forced to buy single tickets and pay more.After I read on the website thatFamily ticket: 1 adult + a minimum of 2 children under 18 years old: 50% discountSo this rule is different from the interpretation given by the lady at the reception!!I wrote an email to the director Dalila Rodrigues but she did not reply so far (after 10 days).

If you need a ticket for the monastery (the church is free of charge), go to the second entrance (there are flags there saying ticket office or something like that). Make sure you go there first, especially on a hot day. There are only a few ticket machines, so the queues can be quite long. After that, don't make the mistake and queue again - go straight to the entrance and show your tickets. The queue is most likely the one to the church. You will, however, have to queue there again once you're done with the monastery and want to have a look at the church. By the time you come back, they might have changed the entrance to the church. So make sure, you follow the very small signs or simply ask somebody where to queue. Having said that, both monastery and church are quite beautiful. There is not that much to see in the monastery, however. 10€ per Person felt like a bit much for just the cloister. Still, very beautiful indeed.

However, seeing it from the outside is more than enough. The process of getting in and even walking around inside almost put me off completely.To start with, the Tower's website mentions that you're able to buy a combi ticket there for the Tower, the Jeronimos Monastery and the Archaeology Museum nearby. When I arrived at 9.45am on a Sunday, I was faced with a long queue which didn't move even after the Tower was supposed to open. Eventually the staff announced, with zero sympathy, that their computer systems were down and instructed everyone to go to a nearby tourist office to purchase tickets. After more queuing there, the staff behind the counter told me they didn't offer any combi tickets - only tickets for the Tower. Frustrating, but not the end of the world.As very few people are allowed into the Tower at any one time, there can be a wait to get in even after you've bought your ticket. That is perfectly understandable. However, what they don't tell you is that there's far more queuing to do once you're inside. As the Tower is an extremely old building, its stairways are spiralling and extremely narrow. To prevent tourists bumping into each other on the way up and down, they've developed a traffic light system of sorts, whereby you aren't allowed to enter the stairways to go up/down unless your light flashes green. The problem is, there's not a huge amount to see on each floor, and often tourists will disregard the traffic light system, meaning lots of squeezing past each other on the stairs (which feels far from safe) and even turning back. The resulting effect means you can barely focus on the history and significance of the building, as you have to focus primarily on getting about in crowded, dark and cramped conditions.Frankly, it felt like a relief just leaving the Tower - and admittedly taking a break afterwards by the river, where you can gaze at the Tower from a distance, was a far nicer experience. In hindsight, it would have been better just to have stayed there. What I personally would recommend if you're not bothered about shuffling through dark, cramped stairways and corridors is to come on a Monday. The Tower is closed on Mondays which means that the area itself is quieter than usual, and it's only then, when the gimmicky tourism has been stripped away, that you get a real appreciation for the beauty of the Tower, which is really quite impressive to behold.

Best to wander the streets of old Lisbon and get lost a few times and end up at a very small cafe with the locals if possible.

My take-away:  Lisbon's tourism department can do a better job of managing the lines like issuing tickets with a set time for entrance, so that you don't have to wait on a first come first served basis.  Not sure why they issue generic entrance tickets, but the monument can only accommodate x number of people at a time.  It was pure torture in the blazing August sun.  Try coming later in the day when the lines thin out ....or purchase tickets days before your visit (tickets are valid for one year).  Not sure how the latter helps since you still fall in line to enter the tower though....perhaps buy your ticket in the summer and come in winter where there is nobody there :-(

There was an awkward situation where people on the top really needed to step into the stairs before the lights turned red again, but people who tried to get to the top got really annoyed because they thought people on the top should just wait.

Supposedly built as a fortress to protect Lisbon. Interesting to see the design and architecture that covers almost 360 degrees of possible enemy intrusions. There are windows for cannon fire, armory, room for King to have his meetings and discussions, top watch tower et al. There are around 93 circular steps climbing up, a bit steep though. Each step is almost one foot high and hence, need to be strong knees required to climb.The monument is wheel chair friendly and the staff is helpful too.The architecture is medieval and at places Gothic. There are specific pieces of animal extrusions, particularly a Rhino which could be viewed from ground level.

We arrived at 4 pm, without having purchased tickets in advance.  Waited in line until 5 pm, when our line was the last group allowed in (gate closes at 5 pm). Meanwhile, the other line of visitors, with Lisboa cards, were allowed in more frequently and in larger numbers. When we were finally allowed in, we followed a group of more than 100 from the Lisboa line.  The stairs to the top of the tower were jammed full of people, going up and trying to get down.  Once at the top, the views are really nothing special (when compared with St. George Castle). The approximately 1 hour wait in the hot sun really detracted from the experience.  The Belem area itself is not attractive and it is an approximately 10 - 12 Euro Uber cost from downtown Lisbon, each way.  There is no comparing the Tower experience with the (St. George) Castle.  The latter was a 5 out of 5.  Unless you have a half day to waste and have seen everything else you want to see in Lisbon, I would not bother with the Belem Tower.

A staircase is usually a minor phenomenon either in a house or in an urban community, but here it absolutly steals the attention. Believer or not one should reserve ample time to let the meaning of this staircase sip in. You dont even need to climb these nearly 600 steps, it is sufficient just to look at them and meditade. The result is strictly personal, but in all cases tremendous. And those steps demand all the attention instead of the church and the countless chapels. Concentrate on the steps!

Located in the hillside outside of the main town in the Nogueira suburb, there is a free car parking area at the bottom of the steps that start to lead you up the hillside to the church.  The car park is fairly small and occupied as well by what appear to be motorhomes overnighting, but you can also park in the road on the perimeter of the car park.  It’s also a long but simple walk from Braga town centre if you really want to stretch your legs and this seemed to be a very popular option for many.  In the car park location there is a cafe and a restaurant, as well as the funicular station. But for those wanting to enjoy the full stairway experience, the wide zig zag steps start at this point making a way through the forest.  This part of the walk has much long stretches until you reach the bottom of the church steps which are shown in most photos.  You probably need a good 20 minutes to reach the actual church steps or longer if you want to rest and admire the views along the way.  The views are spectacular almost immediately you start the climb and just get better as you get higher up.  Once at the main church area, there is a glorious viewing area and this is probably the best photo opportunity of both the views and the church.  The final steps up to the church are incredibly ornate with numerous fountains and statuettes to admire.  At the top, there is a very wide open area and of course the church to visit which is also beautiful.  Around the church there is lots to see and do including grottos, a boating lake, woodlands, the top of the funicular, cafe, restaurant, shop, toilets (€0.50), and a few ice cream sellers.  There’s also lots of picnic benches in the woodlands just above the church and this was very popular with large local families when we visited.We walked up and down, and viewed all the sights, but with a bit more consideration we’d recommend to a) take a picnic, b) walk up and view the sights, c) get the funicular down.  This could make for at least a half day inexpensive outing which apart from the cost of the funicular (€1.50 for a single, €2 for a return at the time of writing).  You can also drive up to the top along a steep winding cobbled road and make use of free limited on street parking near the top if you really don’t fancy the climb.A very beautiful and well looked after treasure in Braga.  Highly recommended.

They have two cars on two tracks going up the hill on a very steep climb. Each car has a water tank in it. The one at the top of the hill is filled with water and when the brakes are released it goes downhill. Attached to it is a long cable which is attached to the other car on the opposite track. So as the first car filled with water goes to the bottom of the hill it pulls the other car up the hill. When the car gets to the bottom of the hill the water tank is empty. You can use it both going up and down for $1.50.

The architectural work involved in building a masterpiece such as this is really impressive. You can start at the bottom of the hill and you can walk up. It’s not going to be easy there’s a lot of steps and it was designed that way to be a burden it’s like a penance. Or you can take the easy route there is a Trolly car that runs on water for euro 1.50. The view from up here is impressive to say the least and the church at the top will not disappoint.

The bus only takes 20mins from Braga town centre ( bus no 2 and ticket is €1.65 could be bought from the bus driver ). You can either take elevator to go up ( single : €1.5/ return:€2.5 if I remembered correctly). I bought return by mistake as the cable driver did not speak English and on the price board that did not say neither. So I only took elevator up and then walked down . The place is not big as only 2-3 hours maximum for you to walk around. I was told the restaurant up there was very good with view overlooking Braga however I did not try while I was there. Overall, nice pleasant visit and walk if you fancy a walk and view of Braga from high up.

A magnificent mansion full of secrets and riddles.  An amazing place that brings back childhood memories , fantasies about mysterious castles and gardens. The creator of this place had an unbridled fantasy, which he put into practice with great panache. Numerous pits and underground passages, shortcuts hidden between paths, mysterious buildings and a system of underground corridors carved into the rock.  A place a bit like a fairy tale, a huge garden with amazing greenery and even more interesting architecture.  Unusual architectural creations woven into the beautiful nature of the gardens provide several hours of fun for the visitors.  The 27 m descent to the Initiation Well is very impressive, from where you exit through a rock tunnel in another part of the garden. The dark system of rock tunnels called the Labyrinth  and the Waterfall are the greatest attractions of the garden.  It's a perfect place to take photos. It is worth spending more time than on other attractions of Sintra. Interesting place worth visiting.

So many places to explore. Beautiful gardens, grottos, waterfalls, viewing towers, tunnels, and architecture. ""Quinta de Regaleira is a UNESCO World Heritage site designed by the wealthy Portuguese businessman Carvalho Monteiro Carvalho Monteiro in 1904.Italian architect Luigi Manini designed the four-hectare estate with its enigmatic buildings, believed to hide symbols related to alchemy, Masonry, the Knights Templar, and the Rosicrucians. The architecture of the palace, split over five floors and has an ornate gothic façade that evokes Roman, Gothic, Renaissance and Manueline architectural styles. The construction of the current estate commenced in 1904 and most of it was concluded by 1910. The outside façade of the grand house is decorated with gothic turrets, carved gargoyles and other ornate features. Inside, the building spreads over five floors, but it’s very sparse in actual original details. The true wonder of the Quinta da Regaleira are the grounds, which cover 4 hectares and were inspired by the owner’s mystic ideologies.The gardens are incredibly ornate. Set on a hillside, a multitude of fountains, grottoes, statues, caves, and ponds are connected both above ground via lovely paths and by a series of underground tunnels lit today by strings of Christmas lights. The grounds also include a chapel and an aquarium, built to look as if it naturally existed amongst the rock.""If you have time, I would recommend the following 5 sites while in Sintra. This is my order of personal enjoyment, although I liked all of them a lot.- Quinta da Regaleria- National Palace of Pena- Castelo dos Mouros- Palacio de Monserrate- National Palace of SintraWe stayed one and a half days, arriving in the late afternoon we hit the National Palace of Sintra first before it closed and then went right on to the Quinta da Regaleira by foot. This really worked out well. The Quinta da Regaleira came in way above expectations for me and the National Palace of Sintra, as well.The second day we started at Pena, then the Moorish Castle, followed by Monserrate on our way out of town. We wanted to swing by Cabo da Roca and didn't want to drive through the center of Sintra on our way to Lisbon via rental car.The gardens and Palace of Monserrate are beautiful. I would definitely recommend visiting. But I have to say that each one of the 5 really complement each other. We are glad we structured our itinerary to have enough time at each one.  "

The park itself is very large and beautiful, the day was hot, but due to the many trees and the shade from them, the heat was not felt so much.  On the territory of the park there is a palace, a well of initiation and many more not big constructions. I recommend to visit.

After all, its architecture,  a clear pattern of eclecticism,  strikes with an abundance of elements of completely different styles . Pena Palace  is not so old,  this summer residence of the Portuguese royal family was founded here only in the mid-19th century. It's hard to deny him some charm, however,  I have mixed feelings about the number of styles used in this summer palace. On the other hand, an interesting photographic object. No taking photos inside. An interesting palace. At the same time beautiful and kitschy. Beautiful gardens guaranteeing a really pleasant walk and wonderful vegetation. A place worth visiting.

Pena Palacio won't because of its brilliant colour, mix of architecture styles, and amazing views from 'the top'.Going through the palace itself, being herded by a slow moving hoard of tourists wasn't much fun, and while the furniture etc is somewhat interesting, it does get a little tiresome.  Getting past that however, once you get outside, the views are worth it all.  We had beautiful weather so one could see for miles.  It had been so hot and dry all the garden/park walking areas were blocked off so we did miss that part of things but still enjoyed our time there.I would certainly get tickets in town (Sintra) to avoid the long lines at the top.  Try to catch the early bus going up (much cheaper than a taxi) or you will be spending a lot of time waiting for all those in front of you.  The bus loads up not too far from the train station ~ anyone familiar to the area can give directions.  While walking/hiking would work as it is a much more direct route than the bus has to travel, you will have a really good workout ~ it's a very long walk! Seeing it once was worth it ~ go again?  Not sure I need to do that.

There was no room to move in the palace, other than to follow the person in front of you and the tour was crowded with folks trying to get a glimpse of the treasures and while attempting to move ahead in the endless line of people. That was not so fun and I don't recommend if you're sensitive to close quarters. There must be a day or time to tour that's less crowded, but it's not a Saturday morning in September.

We had to queue to get the train tickets to Sintra, get off the platform at Sintra, for the bus up to the palace, to get tickets to see the palace and then after walking up (there was no apparent assistance for anyone with mobility problems and it is very steep in places) we queued another 90 minutes to see inside the palace. There was no information about how long it was going to take you at any point on the slow crawl to the entrance.  Once inside, there is some spectacular Moorish influenced plaster work and tiles and the views are stunning but it wasn't worth spending all that time in a queue with little shade. Hate to think what this is like in August!

Short train ride from Lisbon but long lines at bus for center of city once arrived.    Suggest taking one of the tiny electric vehicles that can hold 3 people and driver.   Our driver was fabulous taking us first to center of town, leaving so we could have lunch and returned at specified time to take us to Palace of Pena.    She was so knowledgeable and helpful stopping on the way at the tiny guest cottage in the park to purchase tickets for the Palace.    We enjoyed the Palace on a beautiful sunny day which made the colors of the Pena that much more vivid.   Never seen a palace in bright yellows and reds.   Extremely whimsical and the views were beautiful.  We didn't go inside the palace since the lines were way to long but outside was fun enough.    Beautiful forest in the National Park if you're a hiker.

The kids preferred walking around the grounds, climbing the big hill to get to the high cross.

Give this a miss, go see the other attractions in Sinta instead.

But for visitors, there are also huge tricks. First, the time. In peak season, the queue is usually very very long, one must be early to enter, otherwise, 3 hours waiting or more is possible!Second, the queue. Around the building, one will soon see a long queue, the queue is actually much much longer than the first sight, if one goes further, one will detect that the que is endless until the real entrance of the palace. So it is better to see the whole queue and then decide whether it is still worthwhile to wait. Third, theticket. Actually, the most beautiful part of the Palace is from outside rather than Inside. If one just want to see outside, one does not have to buy the ticket for Palace but only for the Park, and also, to see the palace from outside actually does not require to stay in the queue, one can just go along the queue and will see some balconies for taking great photos for the fasade of the palace. Fourth, the inside of the Palace is just very very normal. In France, Austria, Spain, Germany, there are plenty of palaces which are much more delicated inside, the Ajuda Palace in Lisbon is also much better inside. (one can imagine, the Palacio da Pena is built on a high mountain, how delicate could it still be in such situation). It is not worth at all when one has to stay in a queue for 3 hours just to see these normal things inside.

Here are my tips:- Do Pena Palace first thing in the morning. This means timing it so you get on the first bus 434 up the hill. The bus starts at 9 am. I took the 7:41 am train from Rossio and arrived in Sintra at 8:21 am. There was ~ 20 of us from this train waiting for the bus and all made it on the first bus. You can use your zapping card to pay for the train to Sintra. The green machines at the train station kept rejecting my U.S. credit card. I found the purple / gray machines in the Lisbon metro stations more credit card friendly to reload. I would reload enough for your return to Lisbon - I only saw green machines in Sintra.- Have cash for the bus - the bus did not take card though I think I saw people zapping their Lisbon train / metro card. They will try to sell you a 15 unlimited bus pass for the day. If you're going to stay in Sintra - as of Sept 2019, the 434 bus (for Moorish and Pena) was 6.90 euros return and the 435 bus for Quinta and Montserrate was 5 euros return - so it's a bit cheaper than the 15 euros. The bus stops to the right of the train station as you exit the ""house"" part of the station. Sometimes it stops at the bus stop (the one w/ seats) and sometimes a little farther down the slope by the other ""pole"" bus stop. It was a bit confusing which to wait at. Bus 434 stops at Moorish castle first then Pena...do Pena first. If you want to do Moorish, you can walk backwards to it. The bus only goes in one direction, so after Pena it goes back to town / the train station. You can search the internet for an image of the bus route Bus 434/435 Sintra for a map. I would not advise walking from the train station...it's quite far. I saw some people take Uber, so that works also - though traffic up the hill will be worse as the day progresses.- Buy your tickets online in advance. It will try to sell you a 3 euro transfer which is a little bus taking you up the hill from the ticket stands to the castle. Unless you have trouble walking - it's not really necessary. It's a steep climb with stairs, but you'll be there in ~ 10 min...not too bad.- If you make it to the castle early before the line gets long to go inside, go inside first  (if you care to) before you spend time taking pics outside as the line will get long. It's a self guided walk through of the castle. Many people say the inside is not worth it - it's ok - not really any less impressive than any other castle. It would have been better if there was an audio guide for context. The descriptions in the rooms are only a couple of sentences. The annoying part is that you can really only go as fast as the group in front of you unless you want to cut them in line...and there are groups on guided tours so you'll be hearing one tour in front of you in 1 language, another 1 behind you in another language - it's quite crammed. - To give context on time - I only visited the interior and took pics of the exterior. I didn't spend time exploring the gardens as I wanted to make in to Quinta and Montserrate. I walked to Moorish by ~12:30-1 pm (and decided to skip it and take the bus back to town to catch bus 435 for Quinta/Montserrate)."

The architect used all available styles you could ever imagine and mixed and matched them all in one single castle: neo baroque, neo classisist, neo gothic, etc. you name it. Many details, the views are great.Unfortunately, this monument is absolutely horridly managed. HORDES of people want to come and see this place, but it is difficult to get there. A ban for private cars would be great, so that taxis, uber and busses can go there faster and more efficiently.They have ticket machines but only one is working. A male staff is standing there and constantly tells people that they should rather go to the ticket booth, cause that one is faster. What a huge lie! The lines there are insane, only two out of six booths are open, sometimes only one. Online booking on spot doesn't work, since there is hardly any internet. So this ""considerate"" employee should get a different assignment, such as actually repairing the ticket machines or sitting in the ticket booth and doing some actual work.Once you have the ticket, no brochure or map or information is given. No app, nothing. You can't even google the history of this place, because: spotty internet.You are being informed of lines to access the palace. NO timed tickets! It is 2019, thousands of people come to the palace but they don't have timed tickets like what?So then you stand in line to access the palace, get pushed through the rooms as if you were in the Vatican, with the only difference that the Vatican museums are actually really worth seeing. The interior is ok, the rooms are beautifully ornated but the furniture is nothing special. No photos allowed either I guess because people would take even longer photographing everything.What annoyed me a lot was that the place is actually not well maintained. You have so many people visiting and generating so much money and you can't restore the palace as it deserves? What a shame!"

The exterior, interior and furniture are all stunning.  In all of Portugal this was definitely the highlight.  However, the management of the site is appalling.  There is one small mini-bus to take you to the top of the hill (€3), but when we arrived just after nine there was already a long queue and we worked out the wait would mean standing in the sun for well over an hour.  Although we had bought the ticket we walked up and it nearly killed us!  Surely there could be a few benches to catch your breath en route and why only one bus?  Two or three are needed to cope with the numbers.  When you get to the top of the hill you join another queue and we shuffled forward for another hour before we actually got into the palace.  I cannot imagine why they do not issue timed tickets, so that you could go and get a coffee or snack, or look around the terraces while waiting and then go to the palace entrance at the correct time.    N.B.  Lots of people bypass the queues.  They are not pushing in (except for the odd one! who tries it on!), but are just going up to the terraces, so do not need to join the queue for the interior of the house.

It wasn't.Approx 20 minutes queueing to buy tickets, then 90 minutes queue to get in the palace (to be fair, the man selling the tickets did tell us it would be this long).Some great views as you walk up to the palace, and the grounds are huge if you fancy a walk around. If you pay only for the park and terrace then you won't have to queue inside - in hindsight, probably a better option.Perhaps when it's really quiet it's better, but we ended up shuffling through rooms with very little to really catch your eye (compare to the Royal Palace in Madrid - perhaps unfair - but that was stunning inside).Overall, probably a ""must see"" if you're in or near Lisbon, but slightly disappointing overall."

That is the biggest imaginable understatement. We caught the train from Rossio station in Lisbon and arrived just before 9am, got a taxi to the castle which is situated at about 1500 feet and then bought tickets for the bus to take us even further up the steep hill to the entrance. The place was already quite bustling and we joined the queue to enter the building which was an interesting rebuilt and extended monastery where no expense had been spared by some German Royal. We were part of a few hundred visitors who shuffled in line along the corridors and through the rooms at a pre determined pace, unable to either linger or increase our speed.when we exited our few hundred had multiplied to thousands and in fact when we were leaving the site at about 12 noon the queues everywhere were indescribable; we estimated that those queuing for tickets would be several hours even getting inside the building. A worthwhile visit but only if you arrive as it opens and with a pre booked ticket."

The grounds are spectacular and that’s all you need to see, inside is like any other European palace, if you have seen one you have seen them all. The better option is to go to the Castelo dos Mouros as you have a better view of Sintra Palace from there. Best way to get to Sintra is take the train from Lisbon, once in  Sintra take the bus to the palace, less than 4 Euros, and make a bee line for the Castelo dos Mouros. If you pay to go to the palace de Pena,  don’t eat there and walk down on the trails.

To begin with, after you enter the main gate, the trek uphill to the Palace is VERY steep and quite long. We were naive enough to believe that it was probably a short walk since our guide book ""EYEWITNESS"" (I'll never buy that book again) did not mention it. Do not by pass the small bus that is available (for yet another fee) - you'll be sorry you did. The Palace is undoubtedly beautiful but we've travelled to many countries, and seen many sights, and never have we seen a major sight with so few people around to answer questions and guide visitors. I felt as if we were being punished for not hiring a private guide or joining a tour group. But here's our biggest complaint - after you trek up to the Palace you have to join yet another line if you want to enter the Palace ( as opposed to drifting around the grounds.) That line is VERY LONG and VERY SLOW MOVING. It was like torture. Every other attraction or museum that we've been to that attracts that many people has time stamped entrances so that people can enter one group at a time and no one has to wait on extreme lines forever and then be packed in to the place like sardines. THIS SIGHT IS VERY POORLY RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

In Sintra (a 40 minute trip) we elected to share a cab (10 Euros) to the site and avoid the line for the bus.  Arriving a little before 10:00 the wait for the interior of the palace was still about 25 minutes.  At about 1:30 when we were leaving my guess is that the wait was at least a couple of hours!

Trip was around 40 minutes long. Got to Sintra, and being reasonably fit decided to walk up to Pena Palace. First walked through the old town then followed Google maps to Vila Sassetti (free entrance) and climbed up through the beautiful gardens. Route is quite obvious just go up. Some way up, within these grounds, are two vending machines in case energy levels are running low and also clean public toilets. The higher you get, the garden changes to look more like a forest. At the top you will get to an information board that gives you the choice of either going right, leading to the lower entrance of the castle, or to the left which goes to the main entrance. We opted to go right which ascends a bit more and leads to a car park. Cross the road and lo and behold, is the lower ticket office plus lower entrance. We decided to do it all in reverse as some other TA members had advised.We bought combined ticket for Palace of the Moors as well. Total price for 2 adults Pena Palace (Outside terrace) and Palacio dos Mouros was Euro 29.44.We also followed TA advice to only see the outer palace terraces and walls and not go in.We then started the visit from the lakes and gardens and wandered up to the top. When you start seeing the long queues to enter, keep to the left as this is where terrace visitors queue. We were glad we took this tip, as the queue for the interior was very very long. No queue for terraces however. Looked at panoramic views and walked all round the walls. Can still use cafe service and bathrooms if you see terraces and also have access to the chapel.Then we exited by the top main entrance and walked down to Palace of the Moors some 10 minutes down the road to the left when you exit main gate.

However we much preferred Quinta da Regaleira and Morrs Castle for the overall experience.Pena Palace gets very busy and that seems to take away from the atmosphere. It really does feel like a tourist trap from the moment you enter.Its worth buying the ticket online to save queuing, you then use the e-ticket which can be scanned from your phone. When we visited on a Monday the queue (by 11am) for the Palace rooms was all the way back to where the shuttle bus was dropping people off. We decided to avoid it even though we had paid for a joint Palace and Park ticket. We couldn't quite believe people were waiting in such a ridiculously long queue!! We wondered if maybe people had thought the queue was for the attraction in general rather than the Palace rooms specifically (as that isn't made clear until near the front of the queue). So be careful of that! We walked up next to the queue to eventually reach the terraces and walls surrounding the Palace. To us this was what was special about Pena Palace... the colours, the architecture and the views. So unless you are really interested in the rooms inside, I would save your money and time.We explored the gardens in the direction of the High Cross. This was a tranquil walk, however the High Cross did not provide the views we expected as the trees are quite overgrown and obstruct the view of the Palace. All in all I am not sure I would recommend Pena Palace above some of the others in Sintra. Unless you plan the trip well and are very efficient with your time here.

Inside the Palace tour is simply standing behind various plastic dividers, taking a quick look, then moving on for the people in line behind you. The parapets were “crawling” with people. It was hard to see the architecture due to the number of people.We enjoyed the Quinta da Regaleira much, much more. I would recommend giving Pena Palace a pass.

Most of the line didn’t have shade so if coming bring a sunshade or some sort of make sure you wear lots of suncream. The castle was good but a constantly moving line of people so very touristy crowded... no photos allowed inside either. While nice I would probably recommend just visiting the gardens. Because it was so later after seeing the castle we didn’t see a lot of the gardens but seemed nice, just very busy everywhere. Perhaps very early in the morning would be better but I think you can’t avoid the crowds. Best part were walking along the castle walls, great views from here. It was cool just know when your getting yourself into (a very crowded day). Also don’t count on getting the bus up. I think it only ran every 15-30 mins and only held about 20 ppl each time.

We got there very early so the queues were fairly short. However, we had a baby in a sling so we did get to skip lots of the queues - there is a special line for parents carrying children aged under 3. Thank goodness. The palace itself was interesting but very slow moving, lots of your groups gummed it up. We walked up from the entrance to the palace. It was perfectly doable. The ticket booth didn’t tell us we needed to buy 3 euro tickets to take the bus up the hill. So we queued 30 mins for the bus then realised we couldn’t buy tickets on board so just walked. This Pena is ok. I was glad to leave and felt it was completely overhyped and poorly run. But many thousands of people go there everyday so there’s not much incentive to change how it’s managed. It’s a sausage factory. I much preferred the Monserrate palace and the Queluz palace. They were utterly stunning, pretty much empty and we could drive there. Magical.

We had opted for the bus ride up, but discoverd it doesn't start running until 9:30. Still, the walk through the palace was not too crowded (just stay a step ahead or behind the tour groups). The grounds of the park are HUGE! Not flat, so there could be a lot of walking. We opted for the bus to go to the countess house, but that didn't start running until later, so we were left waiting again. By noon then the traffic was gridlocked, (3 Uber drivers canceled, and another was said to be at least 18 minutes away), so took a tuk-tuk back to town. Not in shape to walk down the steep hills. Going inside the palace itself was definitely worth the visit.

The place is very cool.  Make sure you see the inside rooms.  This is what the wait is all about.  You can get up there and walk around the outsides, no problem.  But you have to wait in another line once you get to the castle grounds to enter inside.  No photos inside, which is fine.  There were many finely decorated rooms which we enjoyed.  The outside views were stunning.  Two things, we tried to take Tuk-tuks up to beat the long line waiting for the bus.  DON'T do it.  These little vehicles are fun, but can only get you up so far, then you have to walk the last 20 minutes up hill.  No fun.  Read the Rick Steves guide and take the bus.  At least we were smart and took the bus back to the train station.Finally, get there early, or don't go.  We got there about 10, which was close to pushing it. There was a line of about 50 people to buy tickets outside of the castle (we purchased ours online before we left.  They are not date specific, so do it this way if you know you're going).  And there were about 60 - 70 people waiting to get into the inside of the castle.  Outside castle is always zero wait.  By the time we left at about 11:30, there were probably 200 people in line waiting to get inside.  And it is NOT a fast moving line.  So, you've been warned.  Train ride from Lisbon is nice and easy from Rossio.

There are far better places to see in this world that Palacio Pena. Like so many, I bought my tickets on line - waste of time and effort. Eventually getting into the tacky looking building, I was hugely disappointed to be told that I could not take pictures ( I agree with the reviewer who said that that is probably because there is nothing to see inside really). Such a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favour, everybody take of those rose tinted glasses and see this for what it really is - an overpriced nonentity. A previous reviewer rightly likened it to lego bricks. Have an ice cream somewhere else and pocket the change and enjoy the time. Honest - you will be getting a good deal by doing so.

We arrived at about 1130 and it is true to say that Sintra was heaving with tourists and tourist buses were jamming the narrow streets.Nevertheless, with good planning, we did little queuing and our 1630 arrival at the Palace meant we walked straight in.Seeing the Palace from the distance is quite a spectacle, but being up close is really quite an experience.We decided that after a very hectic day, and with limited time available, we would restrict ourselves to the Park. The ticket enabled us to climb right up to the Palace (there is a wee bus if required) and walk all the way around the walls, giving some amazing views. I am sure that the gardens would be beautiful in spring/early summer. The walk across to the chalet and the lakes is also well worth it, although the signage could be improved and as our arrival was late in the day, there were no maps available.I would have been more than happy to award this a five star rating had it not been for the toilets at the entrance, which were frankly disgusting and literally turned my stomach. Not acceptable. We arrived in need of the loo, not knowing that there were other, very good options up at the castle. Not good enough!

Pena Palace is the most visited tourist site in Portugal for its unique Disney-like style. It was constructed in the 1800s for the king’s wife and stands out quite a bit on the mountain above The town of Sinatra, particularly when juxtaposed with the Moorish castle just below. We were lucky enough to come in September when the lines were only 15 minutes long. During peak season, tourist will wait for 4 hours or longer to buy their tickets and get into the next line to enter the complex itself! It was very cool to see, but certainly wouldn’t have been worth a 4 hour wait. We taxi’d up, which was great because the driver took us past the busses full of tourists so that we could beat them in the line! Be sure to do the wall walk.

We were there 3 hours and still hadn’t visited the stables or any of the garden walks. The architecture is amazing and to think it has been built on the absolute summit with rocky outcrops appearing through the walls makes it even more so.  Like a Disney castle, through every archway it opened up a new vista. Highly recommend a visit. We tried to find it by car but gave up and caught the 434 bus which takes you to the entrance.

We suspected that they queue was tour bus people waiting to tour the palace interior but no one was present to ask. We couldn't get past the queue to enter the grounds. All we expected was access to the outside palace grounds and ramparts outside the palace and had decided the tour wasn't worth it. There was no crowd control, nor assistance. Bottom line we paid a premium to purchase tickets in advance from a third party when the park ticket site wasn't functioning and never got through the palace gate. It was such a bad experience we decided against walking the 500 m or so, to the Moorish Castle fearing a similar fate. Everything we did was possible without a ticket, up to evaluating the queue length between the ticket processing gate and the first palace gate. We were more interested in the views and vistas from inside the palace grounds and didn't even get that. Disappointed? Yes. Upset? also yes. We salvaged our day-trip to Sintra by walking up from the train station to Pena Palace and back through the Park.....beautiful. We toured the National Palace in downtown SIntra and enjoyed that very much. This place is overloaded and I couldn't encourage others to take a day out of their travels to see it.

My suggestion is to walk the top of the bridge first, in order to enjoy likely the best views of both Porto and its sister city, across the river. Wait to see the subway train emerge from the city's underground and zip over the bridge.Next, you may want to go down to the lower level for a different perspective. You can get there by foot, on the antique stone stairs while admiring the narrow walls closing in on you, the derelict medieval ruins and the picturesque windows and balconies. Other options to descent to the water level are the Funicular dos Guindais or the Elevador Lada Ribeira.

Then just stay on the train (or change, depending where you are staying) and turn around at Jardim do Morro. It was fun to be able to take this scenic route and have an immediate overview of Porto on the way in, but the main reason I'm writing is to update people on the crime situation I'd read about on this forum before our trip. I'm happy to report that we didn't see anything like what others have described. Perhaps we were lucky, or perhaps police have cracked down on criminals preying on tourists, but all we saw, day and night, was other tourists on the bridge. The only dangers were trams on the top level and cars on the lower. The footpaths have ample space, but many pedestrians are distracted. I am grateful for the warnings provided by other Trip Advisor reviewers, and thankful that they proved unnecessary. One should always be vigilant, but on the basis of personal experience, I'm happy to recommend dinner on the Villa Nova de Gaia side, as its restaurants are empty in the evenings. I've already written a review of the Casa Dias, and I'd be surprised if reservations were required anywhere on that side of the riverfront. Then it's a lovely romantic walk back across the bridge, which is lit up at night.

The bridge links Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia (the place, where (almost) all wine cellars of Port Wines are located) over Douro River. It was built at the end of the 19th Century and it is the typical iron bridge of this period. The bridge has two floors, the lower one is for cars and people, the upper one is for the metro and people, so you can cross the river by walk on the two floors.

On the Porto side there is a funicular that takes you up to the city street level where you can pick up a Line 22 tram that takes you into the centre or you can walk it in about 10 minutes. On the other side of the bridge is a cable car that takes you from the upper level of the bridge down to the riverside in front of the wineries.

In earlier years it was associated with explorers and sailors and is the resting place of Vasco de Gama. If you travel independently you are required to purchase your tickets in a separate building at machines that occasionally break down, then get into another long line to enter. Best to purchase your entrance on line. Better management is required here, it can be frustrating. You can also visit Santa Maria church attached to the monastery. The admission is free. Another must attraction while in this vicinity is the Explorer monument and Belem Tower. The gardens here could use some landscaping. Nearby, you have to locate the Pasteis de Belem bakery to indulge in the original Portuguese custard tart. The Belem district is a worthwhile visit.

Combine it with stops close by - Padrão dos Descobrimentos, Tower of Belem and Pasteis de Belem. No additional charge with the Lisboa card.The Jeronimos Monastery is the most impressive symbol of Portugal's power and wealth during the Age of Discovery. King Manuel I built it in 1502 on the site of a hermitage founded by Prince Henry the Navigator, where Vasco da Gama and his crew spent their last night in Portugal in prayer before leaving for India. It was built to commemorate Vasco Da Gama's voyage and to give thanks to the Virgin Mary for its success.

Here are some useful tips:Take a taxi. The tram or bus will not let you off exactly at the line to get in, but a taxi will. It is only 6-9 euros from downtown, so if you are not destitute it is a good option.Arrive early. This is one of the most visited sites in Lisbon, and the tour buses create outrageous lines.arrive at 9:45, 15 minutes prior to opening. Tickets : you can buy tickets online for 12.5 euros prior to your visit. Make sure you go on the ticket holder line, which is on the far right of the palace if you are facing the palace. If you do not buy the tickets ahead of time, if you are a part of a couple or more, get on the ticket line and have someone in your group go to the ticket buying line, which is located near the center of the palace. This ticket buying line splits, so stay to the right if you want tickets only to the monastery and cloisters. BuyingTickets the day you arrive is 10 euros per person. Afterwards: after you see the monastery you can stroll across the street to see the explorer monument, and then walk or take a scooter to the Belém tower. But do the monastery first, for reasons I described above.

Belem Tower is  a beautiful military structure from the 16th century. A very interesting tower on the bank of the Tagus River. The construction of the Belem Tower in the age of geographical discoveries was not accidental, as it was the watchtower of the Lisbon port and also a landmark for returning ships. This building stood in the middle of the Tagus River and it was not until the earthquake in 1755 caused the riverbed to change its course.Since then, the tower stands on the right bank of the river.

There is even a small scale model of the tower that allows visitors to see the a small reproduction of sections of the tower before walking over to the actual tower. This was a great place to visit under a clear blue sky on a sunny September afternoon.

You can't take a stroller in and believe me - you wouldn't want to. You park them at the door. If you're child can't walk or tackle narrow stairs without railings, you will end up carrying them. We did that one year, then decided to wait until he was older and could walk, to go back. we found it a little precarious for child-carrying. The views are stunning, the castle is beautiful and well-run. You line up outside. They count the number of people that go in, and while one group views, the next waits for the first group to explore and exit. The wait is never long. Local vendors play music and sell goods outside. There is a large park in front to hang out, eat a picnic lunch, or let the kids run. Parking is always busy. We've had better luck in the morning than the afternoon. Be sure to read the signs before ascending or descending the interior stairs. The stair cases are so narrow, that if you see a red light, it means stand and wait before going up, because people are coming down (and vice versa). There is a restaurant  (you'll pass it to get to the tower) but it's tourist-zone prices. You have to save your food receipt to put it under the receipt reader for bathroom access. Or, pay one euro to use the bathroom if not dining or if you lost your receipt. Bathrooms are spacious but usually messy from a high volume of visitors.

The land to the north, now covered by highway and train tracks was reclaimed when the river was deepened to facilitate navigation.While you can visit inside and climb a winding spiral staircase to the observation platform, we didn't have the time of patience to endure the long line, but got some great pictures of the exterior.Be sure to make the short trek 2.5 miles to Belém to see it and the impressive monastery.

Got there too early at 08:30 am as it did not open until 10am . QUEUING : It gets very busy so my advice is start queuing 45 mins before opening as i did, i was second in the queue, as they open the tower you have two lines one for buying tickets  where you can get a combo ticket for the Jeronimos Monastery  and one for pre pay and as i had a Lisboa Card i was the first to go up the tower . The rooms along the way have not much in them  but very historical and tell you all about the tower and it`s history , The views from the top are breathtaking , and there is a green light system where , When it`s green it`s clear to descend or red to hold . When i left at 10:30am the queue to get was getting very busy , Approx 150 people !Yes a lovely place to visit and the views are great and one more tip there is a lovely cafe/restaurant about 200 yards  from the tower on the river it`s self and had a famous Pasteis de  Nata and a cup of tea & sat outside and relaxed .

Very clean with all the facilities good wifi, washing machine and clothes dryer you can use, rooms are cleaned daily.

We were also planning on purchasing a Tower of Belem / Jeronimos Monastery duel entry ticket that was touted in most of the articles and reviews I read while planning this part of our trip.  We took the 15 Tram from Lisbon (you can purchase a 24 hour transportation pass at a train station that can be used on trains, trams and busses). Arrived in Belem and walked to the Tower only to find two lines - one for prepaid tickets and the second for those of us who didn’t get our tickets early. The wait was at least 45 minutes.  Once we finally got into the Tower, we learned that they stopped selling this duel ticket in August.  Lots of disappointed folks.The interior of the Tower was ok, the lower exterior level offered a lovely view of the water.  However, getting to the upper levels involves ascending a very narrow spiral staircase with 93 steps.  Claustrophobic?  Have a few extra pounds on your gut or hips?  Have difficulty breathing?  Nope, as cool as it would be to get up to the top, this staircase may be a challenge for you.  My suggestion, pass on going inside and instead, enjoy walking around the amazing exterior of Belem Tower.

In Porto catch the suburban train from either Porto Sao Bento or Porto Campanha Train Station. The fare is 7.20 Euros return and the journey takes about 60 - 70 minutes. At Braga Train Station walk out the entrance and there is a row of bus stops, take Bus number 2 and the last stop is Bom Jesus do Monte. The fare is 1.65 Euros one way and the trip takes 20 minutes. Once at the car park of Bom Jesus do Monte, this is where the number 2 bus terminates, you have two options to get to the church. One is by a funicular or elevator, the other is to walk up lots of steps. The funicular is unique in that it is water powered and costs 1.50 Euros one way or 2.50 return. It is quick and painless but you miss a lot. To walk you climb 400 easy gradual steps, with each switchback location housing a scene from the story of Christ. These scenes are housed in beautiful white little temples and as you climb higher you see Christ’s trial and eventual Crucifixion. You then reach a landing which leads to the famed 250 steps up the criss crossing climb to the church. Here the story of Christ continues and you also see fountains dedicated to the five senses. This is the amazing scene, the one everyone photographs. So taking the steps, all 650 of them, is well worth the effort with lots of rewards. Once at the top you will see the magnificent church. Then come down by the funicular if you walked up. Catch Bus 2 to Praça da Republica in the centre of Braga and make your way around the many churches and small palaces. You can weave a path that takes you back to Braga train station and see many of the tourist sites along the way. Then the train back to Porto. This is a long day and will take between 8 - 9 hours but it is cheap and rewarding.

Some people can manage the small paths between major ones, and some cannot, but there is  plenty to opportunity to enjoy the garden.  If you can catch an explanation of the two wells, it is interesting, but only the most nimble and least claustrophobic will enjoy those tunnels.  No way I would do a guided tour unless you have a private one.Bottom line is avoid the heaviest tourist times which make this a marred experience:   Stay overnight in Sintra a couple of nights if you can.  Go to this place and wait to enter first thing in the morning.  Do the Pena Palace at the last entry time of the day (or maybe exactly at lunch time)."

The ushers will push you along at the beginning of the well descent, but don't worry too much - they just want to keep things moving and you'll have time a couple flights down to take some awesome photos.The rest of the grounds are just as impressive, with cavernous tunnels (now with LED lighting!)  and plenty of hidden benches and rest stops.

The steep slope is incorporated into an exotic design with caves, statues, waterfalls, streams and large scultures. The foliage is beatufil all over.

Beware.We took bus 435, which does a big loop, from Sintra main train station. It is hop on hop off for 5€, no single trip option.

E- ticket holders may be able to enter here.At ticket office be sure to get a map, and optional 3€ audioguide. 1 per couple is sufficient, not critical info and you can re-play. Activates at listening posts spread throughout grounds.Regalera website has downloadable map which is copy of pages from Insight travel book. On that map it is suggested that guided tours are available hourly. They are, with reservations, for groups >10. So call ahead if you want one.Also on map are routes of the tunnels leading away from the Initiation Well. If you want to be able to explore all without going down the well, take a look.A note on busses. Bus 434 is the most popular bus (doesn't go to Regaleira), and the stop near the national palace is jammed with people and busses in the afternoon. If you are looking for any other bus stopping there, stay sharp as busses may not stop if nobody is waving from the crowd, or stop briefly in the street if pull-out is full.Bus 433 stop near main station is down the street past the cafes, around the corner, near the gorge.We took bus 467 (Scotturb) from Oeiras to Portela stn, 4.80€, then train, then bus 433 to Regaleira. Less than 90 min door to door.Enjoy.

The focus is not one the mansion itself (although it is still quite amazing and detailed), but on the surrounding towers and gardens. The intricate underground passages and wells is what truly makes this site special.Again, while tickets can be purchased online for a 5% discount, you will need to stay in the queue to purchase the audio guide.The audio guide is definitely worthwhile as there are limited signage explain the design and significance of the various sites. It also points out many interesting design facets of the mansion that is otherwise hidden from plain view.

Maybe because it was early October ...but during my 2 hr visit there were nowhere near as many tourists as there were at Pena Palace.  And yet, I found Regaleira so much more interesting to tour.One should note, as of early October only the first floor of the estate was open.   There was a sign indicating that the other floors were undergoing renovation.   You do get to see the dining room and a few other rooms.... which were surprisingly modest in size ...maybe because this is not a Palace but more of a residence .   The more humanistic size of the rooms made it all the more interesting to me.  Upon entering the property I immediately started to walk up hill toward the Initiation Well ... the walk takes 5-10 minutes but if you are one of the first to enter the property you will have the well all to yourself...for at least 5 minutes that is.  Be mindful of the few signs that point the way up hill.After visiting the well,  the walk is all downhill.  There are numerous little passage ways, grottos to explore and wonderful architectural structures to accent the landscape.   One can only imagine what these gardens were like after they were first installed back in the early 1900s.  The park at Regaleira far exceeds the park at Pena Palace in terms of visual interest and ease of finding your way around using the map that was provided.  But both parks have a sense that time and nature are taking their toll. I just wish the organization operating Regaleira had the funds to restore the park to what it would have looked like when it was first constructed.  For example.... the park has one feature that must have been a very amazing site for those house guests staying at Regaleira....an outdoor aquarium !   This was perhaps one of the most interesting structures for me .   Yes, today it no longer functions and in fact you have to look closely to see that it was actually an aquarium.  But there is this large stone structure.. the size of 2 - 3 cars that served as a fish tank.  The tank is carved out of what appears to be stone with glass inserts / portholes allowing guests to Look at the sea life within.  In today’s world an aquarium probably seems very ordinary but back in the early 1900s , at a private residence no less, it  must have been very futuristic. There are 3-4 park features that represent a maze of tunnels carved into the mountain...and at least one of them was fairly long and you definitely needed a flashlight to explore it.  Again, for children I could see these passage ways being great fun... but as for myself it was rather ordinary.   I would still invest time in touring Quinta da Regaleira only to imagine what visitors back 100 years ago  first thought when entering the gardens for the first time.

""Like Disney but real"" was my son's comment. And the wells were very atmospheric.I'd have loved more information on the history & symbolism of the place, & no chance of a book in the gift shop, which must rate as one of the worst. However the terrace restaurant was really nice. We drove there & I'd not recommend this, as navigation & parking are very difficult.

We stayed two nights & were glad we did.We really enjoyed the town after the tourists left around 5pm.Buy tickets for the palace at the downtown ticket office for smaller lines upon your arrival in town if you came in the night before. The tourist office at the train station is packed with people.You can also buy your tickets online for a small discount.From the train station, walk the 10 minutes up a slight hill on a beautiful walk to get to town & the tourist office.At 9am, take Uber up to the palace & not the bus so you can arrive right when the palace opens at 9:30am. The bus is crowded & you might not get on the first bus.As it’s a big one-way long loop around Sintra, get an Uber as follows:With your back to the tourist office in town, and not the tourist office at the train station, make a right turn & follow the road until it dead ends. Make a left turn & walk uphill about 5 minutes. When you see a parking lot & a road going up to your right, call Uber. Do NOT call until you reach this point as there is no where for Uber to wait for you since it’s a small one lane road. Arrive before the 9:30am opening time.Our B&B advised us not to use tuk-tuks due to safety. Uber was around 5E & tuk-tuks wanted 10E to go back to town. Just call Uber when you are finished but expect it will take around 10 minutes or maybe longer for them to drive up the mountain. We waited for Uber.Go into the gift shop & spend the 3E per person roundtrip to take the shuttle bus to the top unless you are in great shape to walk up the steep hill going up to the palace. From where the shuttle bus lets you off, it’s another 10-minute steep uphill climb to the palace.Go immediately into the palace as it gets very crowded fast. When we left the place around noon the wait was almost back to the tram stop so wait was probably well over an hour at least to get in. We waited about 5-10 minutes early in the morning.We enjoyed the interior but liked the views & the exterior even better. We really enjoyed the palace & think it’s well worth seeing. It was one of our highlights on our 18-day trip to Portugal.Bring your own water & lunch as both were expensive there.Go take the tour bus around the park- it only leaves hourly. To get the bus: go back to the tram stop & walk down the hill with the steps to your left. At the bottom, turn right & the bus leaves from the parking lot. Take the bus all the way to the end & see the summer house - well worth seeing. The flowers & grounds are wonderful. The bus stops for an hour for lunch so be sure & ask for the next bus time.Wander around the magnificent gardens if you have time. Well worth it.Now go see the Castle. When you leave the exit at the front gate, turn left & walk 5 minutes down to the castle.Allow 3 hours minimum to see the interior, exterior palace & gardens.Note: they were out of palace brochures in English & told us they were out of it for months. This is inexcusable. We had to ask for information we would have easily gotten from the brochure like about the tram around the park. Get more English brochures!Note: no photographs allowed inside the palace.If you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more."

Acres and acres of small woodland paths and trails through flowers and streams and lakes. It’s amazing. The walk up to the High Cross is very nice and gives a really nice view of the palace.Buy your tickets online before you arrive. Saves money and time. You can get a combo with the Moorish Castle (a few hundred meters down the road). First time I went I took the train from Lisbon and then the bus. It was off season and not too crowded.  Very easy to navigate.  Pro tip — when you’re leaving the palace, pick up the bus near “the lakes” (ie, the stop before the main entrance) and avoid the long queue for the return bus. Second time I went, we came by car from Cascais. Driving in Sintra is not for the faint of heart. We arrived 10 mins before the various palaces/castles opened and the parking spaces were getting pretty full already (also off season), although we parked fairly easily at that hour.

The castle, surrounded by forestland, is the perfect setting for the riot of colors.The gargoyle at the entrance is both beautiful and frightening and the exterior stone carvings wonderful. The rooms are lush and very palace like but definitely worth the visit. The castle as a whole is well worth the time you invest.  It was very busy that day, but we were inside after lunch and it wasn't as crowded as in the morning. There's a bit of steep walking to do to get there, so take the RT tourist bus. If time is tight, take the grounds tour.

It is historic but the interior is quite dark and gloomy.  It has the usual splashes of impossibly expensive decorations, with a strong Victorian (1860's) kind of flavor.  The exterior makes for a pretty picture, and the trip to Sintra is worthwhile if you also do the Moorish Castle (but warning: lots of climbing!), which has much better views.  There are lots of charming places in Portugal so don't just see this and miss the other towns and wonderful food and people. One small operating note: the automatic machines at the entrance that sell tickets are labelled ""PIN Only"", which means they take only debit cards or European credit cards; they act as if they take American credit cards but then refuse to process the request, because American credit cards have no PIN.  No problem: the ticket booth with the person in it down several steps takes American credit cards with no problem."

The gardens are lovely and you will need  time/ a few hours to see the gardens as well. I wish we would have stayed in Sintra more than 2 days to enjoy more sites. The bus is very convenient and will take you to the palaces and castles for a minimal cost. I highly recommend a trip to this palace. I honestly don't understand the negative reviews.

Have this extra ticket BEFORE you go....I do not think that you can buy it once you are there, and people were turned away at the bus and frustrated.  The walk down at the end of the palace is easy if you choose not to take the bus back to the palace entrance.The palace looks like Disneyland from the outside.  The inside is rather fabulous, but even if you are not interested in the furnishings, it was worth the price of admission to see the walls and ceilings which are magnificent.  We were there on a cold, foggy day in October, and it was definitely crowded, but it could be horrible during high season.  To avoid the tourist throngs from the buses that roll into Sintra, we took the last entrance time; the time you take the bus up should be confirmed when you book your tickets at the TI.  Staying overnight at least one night in Sintra makes this late entry possible."

But as most people will be spending a several hours there just to see the main castle here are my lessons learned:- Book a tour or transport ahead of time to get there AS EARLY as possible.  In the slow season they open the main gates at 10am, by 9:30 the parking was almost full and the line was already well along the road to the first parking lot.  Cannot stress enough to get there well ahead of opening time (this precludes taking the train from Lisbon as that eats up too much time)- Get ready to walk up-hill!  Saw several ladies with flat slip-on sandals.  Cute for pictures sure, but I can't imagine the walk up was very nice.  Or maybe they waited for the shuttle bus that takes you from the main gate up to the castle entrance.  But if you can, wear sensible shoes and get ready for moderate uphill walk.- Don't stop on your way up! Do the interior walkthrough FIRST.  The biggest mistake we saw people make was to stop along the walk and take pictures as they passed every gate or nice view.  DON'T stop on your way up, the interior walkthrough line gets atrociously long every minute you delay, to the point where if you didn't arrive early for the main gate, good luck getting through the interior tour (and its a slow moving, single file, no pictures inside, line).  That is, unless you plan on spending an entire day there, but we only had 90 minutes to do the castle so we were on a time budget.  (With this tip we were able to see the impressive interior and pretty much all the exterior at a relaxed pace)Is it worth it?  If you either have the time to deal with the crowds or follow the above tips, yes.  But if you think you can arrive late and spend a couple hours there, you will likely be disappointed by the ridiculous wait.  They're building a new hotel just down the road, so if we got back to Sintra specifically we'll prolly spend a couple days to see the rest of the park grounds (our guide said 3 days is recommended to see everything in Sintra)

It costs us 8.75 eur to the entrance. There was already a short line at the entrance gate. We tried to get tickets at the machines, two of them weren't working, the third one didn't let you pay. So I booked the tickets online through my phone (I recommend you that anyway to avoid lines). At 9.30 gate opened and it didn't take us very long to get in. Meanwhile the shuttle bus had not arrived yet and the lines behind us were already quite long. We walked up the hill to the palace, it's steep but not too bad. We heard guides around us telling their clients to visit the inside of the palace first, because lines would be long if they would visit the grounds first. So we followed them. The palace is beautiful on the inside, very decorative ceilings and beautiful views. Inside the palace walking paths are very narrow, so you have to go slow, even at this early hour. In the end we really enjoyed palace but were glad that we went at this early hour.

There is so much more to Sintra than Pena Palace. To get to Pena Palace you take Bus 434 from the Sintra Train Station. The palace is high on a hill overlooking the historic centre of Sintra. The bus weaves its way through some very narrow streets and to be honest the driver drives too fast. You queue to get on the bus, then you queue to get a ticket to Pena Palace. Palace tickets cost 14 Euros. Once in Pena Palace it is a one kilometre uphill walk or pay 3 Euros for a bus. The actual palace looks okay from the outside. However once at the palace, you cannot take photos inside, you then queue to enter the palace. The entry to the palace is basically single file as it is so narrow. You then shuffle in line behind the ever stopping people in front of you. It is claustrophobic and poorly organised. The views from the palace are good. The crowds are ridiculous. Tours come from Lisbon just to see Pena Palace - for me Monserrate Palace is just much better.

The problem started later when we wanted to go inside of the palace. We were waiting more than an hour to go in. They have a sign like you can not use your camera, but I did a few pictures. After 5 minutes inside the palace a guy who’s working there told me to follow him. I said okay, I knew the photos will be the problem, I believed he will ask me to delete the pictures but he just walked on the long corridor without saying anything. I asked him where we are going and his answer was straight away “outside, you can not stay in the palace”... I told him I know it is my mistake, I am happy to delete the photos in front of you, but he ignored me. He was very rude, I think this is not the right way how they should treat similar problem. I did not use flash. I am still very angry, after waiting an hour to go in there, paid expensive ticket they just kicked me out! After this, of course my husband did not want to stay so he walked out as well. They should warn the people politiely before they show you the way out! By the way, do not buy a ticket inside of the palace, just waste the time and money, I checked a YouTube video and not worth it.

I am a history buff. But OMG nearly two hours in line was a wee bit too much. It did encourage conversation with people in the queue to pass the time of day. So if you aren’t interested in history and not keen on peeking into bedchambers skip this line and tour the outside walls and spaces. Oh and mind the climb up from the entrance to the park. Our traveling companion took the small shuttle. Book in the shop, 3€?

Being dropped off and not have to manage parking and traffic a big bonus.  this place is jam packed even midweek and off season.  The medium size bus tour resulted in lost times to coordinate the group and move at a slowish pace with less mobile people in our group.  On the other hand no lines for tickets are concerns with transportation.If you take a train from Lisbon you will need to take a local bus up to Pena.  Another shuttle is optional for the final section.  It's a moderate walk if you are reasonable active.  The Palace is fascinating and fairly complete.  There are numerous signs to understand the rooms.  Expect crowds and a slow pace.You might consider going late and being there to enjoy the view westward and a sunset.  Our tour continued on to Cabo du Roca which was also interesting.

Don't bother with the more expensive ticket. Just buy the ticket with only access to the parks (also too expensive for what you get) but at least you don't have to stay in line for over an hour and you don't feel as ripped of as what my girlfriend and I did

So I took the suggestions of fellow TA reviewers and stuck to touring only the park and the exterior of the palace.  I also included a tour of the Castelo des Muros which I thought was well worth it.So here are my suggestions....1.  Wear good shoes for walking and climbing... I couldnt believe the number of woman wearing flip flops and sandals.   We are talking about steps and steps and steps, cobblestone walkways, narrow walks along the castle wall with no railings on one side and a good 20-30 foot drop ..... one slip and your trip is over.2. If you want to challenge yourself like I did, you hike up to both the palace and castle and hike back into Sintra.    I started at noon and was back at my hotel at 4 PM...but I also walk fast. I hiked up from across the street from the Tivoli Palace hotel...right across is a narrow walkway which starts the hike... don’t attempt it unless you really want a hike...it has a very steep gradient.  I got to the ticket entrance to Pena within 20 mins...30 mins with rest and photo stops along the way.You can cut off a good 30 mins of strenuous hiking if you take some form of transportation to the entry of the palace ...but you still will have some hiking to do to get to the entrance to see the palace interior.3.  If you combine the castle and palace in one visit .....the castle entrance is about a 15 min walk away....as you exit,the main entrance, make a left and walk 5-10 mins......you will see signs on the right indicating where to enter the castle. The walk back into town is only 15 mins from there but again it is all on smooth cobblestones down hill... .. which can be very slippery .  There are one or two turns you have to make just as you start the walk down to Sintra , so pay attention to the signs...otherwise it is pretty straight forward.If you are a photographer..... I would suggest that you visit the castle first in the morning so the sun is at your back...you will get the best pictures of the Pena Palace then...  I arrived around 2 PM in early Oct. and could not get any good pics of the palace, but I got some GREAT shots of the castle walls4. If you combine the castle and palace in one visit...And you are more interested in the interior furnishings ...then get here when the palace opens.  As many have indicated...if you wait until late AM or early PM expect long lines to get in.  It will eat up your entire day. One planning trick I’ve learned to help pick a better day to visit a highly visited tourist site ....... I go on line to check on the cruise ships that will be in port for the city I’m visiting.  You can just a Google it....    If you see 3 ships in port you should avoid touring a popular site such as Pena Palace at all costs ....unless you tour the interior late in the day when most tours have ended.  I usually look for days when there are only one or no cruise ships in port for scheduling a popular tourist site.5.   I’ve seen my share of palace interiors.... and given the restriction on taking pics of the Pena interior I opted out of taking the tour.   I signed up only for the entry to the park...which was a big disappointment.  There was nothing of real interest to catch my photographers eye despite wandering around on park paths for almost 1 1/2 hours.  One could imagine  what it was like 100-200 years ago strolling through this park .....the wooded area and all the winding cobblestone paths with the numerous little hidden seating areas and water features must have been enchanting back then when royalty had their staff of 100 gardeners keeping it well groomed.   Today the maintenance cost is probably prohibitive  ... but what comes with that lack of maintenance  is a lack of any visual interest If I had limited time and had visited other European  places, I would skip Pena all together both the palace interior and the park and focus my time on The Mores Castle.6.   If you plan to spend time in the park....print out your own park map.   How crazy is it to pay to enter such a large park and for the Pena ticket office  to then inform you that they have run out of maps !!!  The park trails are extensive and not at all well marked... I have no idea what interesting places within the park I missed because I had no map to guide me. Yes... the structure of the Pena Palace is quite impressive.... but you can view all of that without having to pay the price of admission.   Definitely, don’t enter unless you are willing to cue up for a tour of the interior..... the park although nice was not worth the price of admission.

I have mobility issues and I was able to view the inside and the terraces with ease.  Sadly I did not attempt the gardens.  They do not allow you to take photos inside the palace, but you are free to do so on the terraces, chapel and in the courtyard. Inside you will find, massive wooden furniture, leather couches, a bath with a soaking tub, beautiful wallpaper, gorgeous tiles. The architecture is amazing. When you think of it, you realize all this 'stuff' had tobe hauled up that steep mountain road, no easy feat.If you are able to, I was, do walk from train station up to the town, it's a nice gradual walk and great views, lots of placesto rest along the way, many sculptures to see.  For those with mobility issues I would recommend taking the train to Sintra (get there early cause it gets crowded). From the train station take a nice easy walk into the town, you can catch bus #434 just before town and it will take you to the ticket office. At the ticket  office buy a ticket r/t for the green jitney and it will take you up to the entrance.  From there it is a short walk to the gate. I warn you do not think you can walk up to the palace, not if you have mobility issues.

We arrived about an hour after it opened and it was packed. The line to go inside the palace was at least 30-45 minutes long. It's worth the wait though, because the inside is really interesting to look at. There are also a bunch of terraces you can go to. If you're looking for a picture perfect Instagram shot, walk around the palace to the sides - there are less people there and you can find a quiet space. The views from the surrounding turrets are spectacular. I suggest buying your tickets online - you save a tiny bit of money and you don't have to wait online to buy tickets. You just walk right in!

After near an hour of queuing we got to the main door of the palace, but by the time we got there we were pretty frazzled.  There is a fast track lane that allows people to go and visit the terraces, but our very long queue was constantly experiencing people cutting their wait by 2/3s in sneaking in through unroped openings.  It was impossible for us down the queue to stop it.  I hate to say that the cruise groups were just the worst.Feedback would be for the huge cruise ship  groups to go first thing in the morning or last visit in the day when things might be a bit quieter.Frankly if I had my time again I would come first thing in the morning or give the palace a miss.  An hour is too long to wait for just a few historic rooms.The view, however, is a must from the terraces for which that gets a 3.

There is not enough room to pass anybody. Perhaps doing it right at the opening or near closing would make it more bearable, but we found the exhibits not that attractive or original in comparison to other places in Sintra. We loved the Palacio Nacional, Quinta de Regaleira, Castelo dos Mouros and the hike near Vila Sasseti. Palacio da Pena would have been best admired from the outside only.

The Palace is unique and beautiful, and there are some lovely views from round by the red towers..... but it was just too busy. There wasn’t any controls as to how many people could go in and it was just unpleasant with the amount of people in there when we went. Everyone trying to get the perfect Instagram photo, it was a big of a nightmare. Because of this we didn’t stay long, it sort of something you have to visit whilst in Sintra but I wouldn’t plan to spend a lot of time there, once you’ve walked around it once you’ve sort of seen everything and like I said the sheer amount of people make it pretty frustrating!

The biggest complaint by all people we meet is that you only learn that you cannot take pictures of the inside of the castle once you enter.The part I most liked were the views of the Mourish castle.Also, I do not recommend the walk around the wall to those afraid of heights or those with small children.I do not recommend the inside of the pallace and 1 hour should be more than enough for this place.

We made the mistake of buying tickets there and the ticket office does not open until 9:30. They do give seniors 65+ discounts on tickets from 14 to 12.5 euros but you must present ID to prove your age.  They also give you a discount for the Lisboa Card.  While we only waited in line for 25 minutes, you then queue fir the shuttle bus up the steep hill to the palace.  They do not publicize that the bus costs another 3 euros and that ticket also has to be purchased in advance.  We chose to hike up to the palace and then found another long line to access the interior itself.  After waiting for 10 minutes or so and finally seeing how much farther we had to go, we stepped out of line and just toured the ramparts.  Beautiful fairy tale like exterior with sweeping views BUT not worth the price or the time.

The trick is to get to Sintra ASAP by train, jump straight on the 434 to the Palace and take it from there. There’s no doubt the Palace is very busy but the queue moved fairly quickly and not having to buy tickets on the day was a real boon. We also had the restaurant to ourselves for elevenses (everyone else seemed to opt for the coffee shop, which was rammed full). The Palace is fabulous and an essential part of any Sintra trip. Another top tip: walk from the Palace to the Moorish castle and then walk from there back down to the village. You’ll have the route to yourself as hardly anyone seems to deviate much from the main drag.

But sadly there is no attempt to manage the hordes of people who come here, resulting in long waits, both to buy tickets and to get in.  We left Rossio Station at 8:41 and didn’t get into the castle interior until noon, the wait to get in turned out to be almost 2 hours.  A timed entry system like you see in other cities like Rome would help. There are so many ways the ticketing process could be improved - the tourist office in Lisbon was unable to sell tickets, they told us to go to the office at Sintra station - where there was only one window and a half hour wait. From what I’ve read it was even worse buying tickets at the castle entrance.  Then there was another line and an unexpected €3 charge for the mini bus to go up the hill (too much of a climb for us seniors).  At the castle there is no way to know how long the wait will be.Yes we eventually enjoyed seeing the castle and lunch on the terrace afterwards but the whole ordeal was so exhausting we wound up skipping the Moors Palace, Quinta de Regalia etc and getting the next train back!  Everything we read said go early, which we did, but so did everyone else. Ive since read reviews stating that it clears out later in the afternoon.

Well it was exactly that.   One machine only to use a credit cad (must have pin), and apparently 2 counters manned by staff where you could buy tickets.   Hence, very long lines.   We didn't have 'skip the line tickets' but, that didn't seem to matter, because people just seemed to pass us by as there was no staff around.   After waiting a very long time we reached the palace, and the upper interior floor was interesting... but in our opinion was not worth the cost of admission or the wait.  Really cannot complain because we had a good idea of what to expect.   We took the 434 bus up, and it was almost 4 euros each and was again very busy.   On the way down, a taxi probably would have been cheaper, but we took a tuk tuk 5 euro's each, which was a better option than the bus.   Yesterday we went to Quinta da Regaleira, 5 euros each (seniors) and not crowded, much better option.  We fell into the mind set of...you cannot visit Sintra without going to the Pena palace, on reflection the castle may have been a better option.

There is no one to explain what the lines are for.

Buy tickets at the next building on the left from the ticket entrance - about a 5-minute walk away in the museum. Note there are several lines to the ticket entrance - the one furthest to the left is the individual entrance to the Monastery.Buy the tickets from a kiosk. There was an attendant to help us use it. There is a senior discount & the machine takes credit cards.There were tons of huge tour groups inside the monastery that take up the whole width of the hallways making it hard for individuals to pass. We loved the monastery & it was a highlight of Lisbon. It was truly spectacular & a must see stop on a visit to Lisbon. Outstanding architecture. Well worth your time. We loved the ornate sculptures.Tip: The monastery is crowded at opening time, but crowds lessen during the afternoon. The tour groups seem to arrive at opening time.  Better to start with the farthest out the Tower of Belem, than the Monument of Discovery, & than depending on crowds stop here or the cathedral next. If still busy, go buy a pastel de Nata & come back.We spend about 2.5 hours here taking loads of pictures - that doesn’t count the 30 minutes or so we spent in the cathedral. Be sure to go inside to view the inside of the cathedral from the high viewpoint - outstanding.We used the Rick Steves guidebook for Portugal & he does a great job explaining the Monastery. If we didn’t have a guidebook, we would not have understood the history as there was no brochures.Suggestions to the monastery:Have a rope line throughout where the tour groups can stay on one side & still allow individuals to pass on the other side of the rope line. The tour groups monopolized the hallways.Have an employee outside instructing tourists of the different lines: cathedral, monastery & ticket office. It was complete chaos as no one knew where to go or what the lines were for.Please print brochures explaining the history of the monastery & cathedral in different languages.If you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more."

Sure the Vasco de Gama tomb is there, but outside is close enough too and the view is much better from the street. Also, DO NOT take the 28e tram from Lisbon to Belem, take the regular train from Cais do Sodre which is much quicker and MUCH MUCH less crowded this mode also reduces your risk of pickpockets by almost 100%! Great views and the Belem Tower are a short walk. Great day trip from Lisbon!

At the second stop the tram was packed like sardines making it a very hot and uncomfortable journey. Perhaps more practical to take the bus or train link. Secondly, I tried to use a tip to buy a joint ticket from Belem tower as it would avoid the huge queues at the monastery. This would have been a great idea if they had not stopped such tickets a few weeks earlier! Queues at the monastery were horrendous from very early on, mainly coach parties, so if you can buy a ticket ahead of your visit I would highly recommend this.

But there are many more places where you can do just that. The tower is not decorated, so there is nothing special inside. Tip: admire the tower from the outside and leave it at that. Tip for the ones running the show: make just one line for everyone and admit 100 people at the time (i.s.o 60).

However, in mid-November, on a weekday, there was a very dangerous number of people in The Well. It is extremely narrow, steep, slippery and a potential deathtrap if one person falls down. Despite the sign asking people to be considerate towards others, people were pushing. There needs to be supervision / a timed entry system to this beautiful attraction. Overtourism will ruin this attraction unless steps are taken.

Set aside at least two to three hours to explore regaleria palace with a lot of climbing involved. The map provided is a but confusing and you tend to  get lost. The main attraction of Regaleria is the ""initiatic well"" written in Portuguese as ""Poco Iniciatico"". Pictures of this well is widely seen in the Internet and first place to visit at Regaleria. Though its a very steep and tiring route to take to ml and let's out to a little waterfall. Actually if you have someone who would not be able to do the climbing, they can actually use the exit of this point to just enter to see the "" initiatic well"" , as this entry point is at lower grounds and does not require steep climbing. Though you can only examine it from the bottom, at least you can see it, without having to stress yourself. This particular entry point is called ""Lake of Waterfall"" and in Portuguese it is ""Lago de Cascata"". On the whole worth a visit and indeed a fascinating place to visit."

The park is not as big as it seems on the map you receive at the reception and underground tunnels and caves take you suddenly to a completely different part of the garden. It was splendid, never seen a thing like that. We visited with three young boys and they totally enjoyed the caves, the spiral staircase of the Initiation well and wanted to have photos taken in or in front of every construction. Best is to go there relatively early in the morning – as we did – to avoid long queues to the ticket office and some crowd on the site. The park is big enough to accommodate many people without the sensation of it being a crowded place but there can be occasional queues to get atop a tower or walk down the Initiation well. Don’t drive there. The parking is tiny and if you don’t find a spot before you get there, there is no street parking after the domain! Since you’ll be on a one way street, you will be obliged to do a c. 10km detour to get back there! By all means, park in Sintra, nowhere in the town center will be too far from the Quinta, a max of 1.5 km. Just walk up the hill, visit the place and stroll back down...

The palace is breathtaking, very colorful and impressive to see. We were luckily some of the first people in the day that we visited and were able to get some impressive photos (outside only as photos inside the palace are not allowed) but by the time we exited the palace there were hoards of people getting their Instagram selfies climbing every which way possible. Given we visited early in the morning and late November, the day was very foggy and we weren't able to see the vistas that surround the palace. Later in the day the fog did lift but we would've had to content with larger crowds then, so pick your trade off.  The inside of the palace is very unique and impressive to walk through. It's a one way path that staff will keep you moving through. I would also recommend doing an audio tour or having a tour guide to help explain the rooms and history.

It is just as bust off season as it is peak season.The queue outside for it opening was hideously long and was actually for people who already had tickets! I had to leave my wife in the ridiculously long queue and run down and get tickets. Definitely buy your tickets online.Once inside the castle, you are herded along many passageways, still like sheep in the hideously long queue. It is very crowded and really, effectively, you are still in a queue and have been for hours. if you don't like crowds or arre claustrophobic, forget it.You are not allowed to take photos inside and really, there isn't much to see inside anyway. All your photos are going to be of the exterior, so just buy tickets for the outside. This will still get you onto the battlements and terraces of the castle and it's quite a saving.The grounds are absolutely massive and you could spend a whole day here if you wish.  The castle is perched on top of a mountain so even if you are just going from the front gate to the castle and back, it is up and down a hill and will probably be roasting hot, so plan accordingly.Bring food and drink too as there is just two very simple cafes selling coffee, ice cream or very basic and crap sandwiches.Get to Pena either by a few buses from Sintra, which may or may not be full, depending on when you are going, or you can get an Uber which is very handy.So my best advice to you is, get there as early in the day as you can, bring a picnic, buy tickets for the grounds only as you are missing nothing inside and enjoy your day.  The Moorish Castle is also up on this hill, so if you are fit enough, enjoy the location and visit here too!If this review was helpful, please give me a LIKE and check out my other reviews.

Reaching Sinatra from Lisbon is very easy and takes about an hour, by the train from Rosios train station. Though ideally you can finish only one loop in Sinatra, the one which covers Moorish castle, Pena palace, Regaleira palace and Sinatra national palace. So best to take the 434 bus which starts from  Sintra station and cost 6.50 euros. Also take your entry ticket to Pena palace at the station itself, which cost 13 euros for the interior as well as the exterior of the palace, as it saves time at the palace. Once you reach the palace, you can either walk which is a steep climb or take a shuttle which drops and picks you for 3 euros. The interior is very well preserved and you can see genuine authentic arts and decoration. Its worth a visit as you get to see three different architecture and all impressive and majestic. Worth a visit to Pena, though expect to spend at least two hours and start your day accordingly. The last 434 bus from the Sinatra historic center is at 6.20...to the Sinatra station. Though its a 10 minutes walk from the historic center to Sinatra station if you miss the last bus.

If youre able, plan to go on a day with good weather and spend the day hiking around the stunning grounds and through the hundreds of paths and trails that wind all through the wooded area at the base of the palace!  Seeing the palace itself is also quite interesting, but, for me, the outside of it is more amazing than the inside.  The remaining furniture inside comes from a number of different styles and periods and the detail and craftsmanship are some of the finest Ive ever seen but try to go through the inside of the palace before it gets crowded if you want to see anything at all!  Sintra is an easy day trip from Lisbon and this palace and its grounds are the gem of that trip, its absolutely worth the time!!

Too many Instagram posers here. We did not go into the palace itself, but walked around the lovely terraces at 4 pm before closing time in early November. Crowds were thinning and it was nice to walk around and appreciate the building and views. Our hotel suggested going late in the day - it helped a lot. Staying overnight helped us avoid the peak crowds for sure. We were going to take the bus to Pena but it was crowded, so we took a tuk tuk from the historical center. She dropped us off at the Moorish Castle first, then we walked down to Pena Palace. This was a fun way to approach the palace and we learned a few things from our driver as well. (Probably overpriced but worth it.)Tips: Go early or go late, and if possible stay overnight so you can also visit Quinta da Regaleira, Monserrate, and the Moorish Castle. We actually preferred all three of these to Pena Palace.  Moorish Castle was still fairly crowded, but the other two had wide open space to explore and were probably the most beautiful of all. You can easily walk to Quinta from the historic center of Sintra, and catch the bus to Monserrate. Monserrate was amazing and we almost had the entire place to ourselves in early November.

When we visited there was a lot of fog surrounding the palace which gave it a sense of eeriness. There is a small chapel worth visiting here with a small stain glass window.

The architecture itself is mesmerizing and shear size of the whole place that you get to see in your visit. It does get busy but it seems they control it by letting groups in and out. Technically not allowed to take pictures in some areas, but you cant help but to take a few regardless b/c it is amazing. The exterior is also nice and walking around you cant help but admire the sheer art and design of the whole place.Great for pictures and some can be seen here (more on my website) - but my favorites here:Note - I would skip the other musuem areas that cost extra. IT was small and you wont miss much if you dont go in there.

Yes, we know, that every visitor, or 99.5% of them, are confined by time, so it is very tempting to book together the usual set of Belem tours, the Tower of Belem, the Monument of Discoveries, the Coach Museum, etc., but the end result of it is most assuredly going to be a mere check mark on your to-do list.The Jerónimos Monastery, almost 500 years old, is probably the most important of the landmarks in entire Portugal. Featuring the finest examples of what came to be known as Manueline style, incorporating many an element vital for the Golden Age of the then fast expanding Portuguese Empire, such as nautical ornaments (ropes, compasses, etc.), carved in the pastel-colored yellow limestone, the amazing double layered cloister, the ornate arches of the open passageway surrounding the cloister, Church of Santa Maria with its imposing southern portal crowned by - fittingly - the statue of Saint Mary, its majestic nave (now, November 2019, is partially under construction), the refectory of the monastery and the Lion Fountain outside of it, and then the tombstone of the Portugal's greatest poets, explorers, kings, and politicians (from Vasco da Gama of the India route to Luís de Camões, Portugal’s Shakespeare, and from King Manuel I of the Manueline architectural style to the leading modernist Fernando Pessoa), all of the above and much more most certainly merit a separate visit of at least 2 to 3 hours duration. Arm yourself with a good guidebook, download an app, get an audio guide or print out relevant web resources to immerse yourself in the layers of Portugal's rich and illustrious history.

Much of the art is still there and the actual architecture is breathtaking. It is a bit confusing to enter. You must go to the far right to get your tickets to enter and return to the church to get in. As for the monastery, I was impressed to see the cleaning was almost finished in the interior of the church. The classic design of the cloister area was beautiful even in a driving rain. There is an excellent historical, political and religious timeline displayed in one of the rooms in the cloister area on the 3rd floor.  Enjoy this masterpiece! All of our family enjoyed this visit. We walked from here to the Belem tower and back to the bakery to the right of the monastery for a stop at the bakery for the famous Pasels de Nada.Yum!

The place was disorganized when I visited. There are confusing lines to get in, and the tickets must be bought down the road inside the Museu de Marinha at automated machines instead of speaking to a human being (or at least that was the case when I visited). Also, there were no plans available to orient yourself once you finally get in. I had to look for some information at the shop, and even then they had run out of English, French and Italian site maps! The tickets you buy are for the cloister and the rooms adjoining it, the main church is free to get in. The cloister is beautiful, full of ornate architectural touches, but the rest somewhat pales in comparison to other churches and monasteries I have seen in Portugal. The church in particular was underwhelming: cavernous and badly lighted (perhaps only because of the scaffolding in place on one side of the church). It was interesting to see the tomb of Vasco da Gama, though barely because of the shadows and lack of clear lighting. The best feature of the Jeronimos complex is actually the exterior, especially the elaborate church portal, and especially when everything gleams beautifully white in the sun.My advice: if you really like architecture and stone decorations, then do pay the 10 euros to see the cloister. Otherwise, just see the church for free and enjoy the exterior for some good photo opportunities.

We took tram 15E from Downtown Lisbon, and arrived at Belém. Since the queue at the Monastery seemed long, we took a walk to the Belém Tower instead. There was a shorter queue there, and so we finished seeing the Tower first, and then walked back. The walk to the Tower is a good 15 minutes, minimum. However, the walk is lovely, especially the path along the coastline. There was NO “combined ticket” though, so you need to buy them separately at each attraction. The biggest confusion starts when you arrive back at the Monastery. Three queues await you to “pick”, with no signage and everyone clueless as oneself. It doesn’t matter if it is raining or anything, you will need to queue up and find out for yourself the purpose of each queue. (It was lunchtime, and we could see the queue at a distance at the Pasteis de Belém, it was long!)The leftmost is for the tickets. You must go there first. The next is for the Monastery, and the rightmost is for the Chapel, which is free (no need for tickets). But there’s no signage on all these.............you will need to find out for yourself by trial and error........ even if it raining. Luckily for us, since we did the attractions in reverse, we got into queues when they were the shortest, and therefore didn’t waste much time. Last of all, is the third “attraction”. The Pasteis de Belém. When everyone had lunch and came back, we were there, around 3.00 pm. The queue there was the shortest. I guess we were lucky, cause we did everything against the flow of the crowd. The interior of the both the Monastery and the Chapel is beautiful. It is worth the hassle, just have some perseverance, and you’ll enjoy a good day out.

There is no logic in the way the line ups are managed by the staff and the line ups are huge. You line up once to purchase tickets; line up again to enter the monastery and line up yet once again to enter the church.  The tickets are sold in a separate building. The tickets are purchased from a machine with no translation to English. Most tourists were having problems with the machines which is why purchasing tickets took so long.The machine will give you a receipt and tickets separately. Do not leave the machine till it spits out the tickets. I just picked up the receipt that clearly stated i had purchased 2 tickets to the monastery. No other pieces of paper/tickets were provided. When we tried to enter the monastery we were denied entry as they needed the tickets. When i went back to where I purchased the tickets the attitude was too bad! So please ensure you have separate tickets for each person before leaving the ticket machine.We lined up in the pouring rain for the free access to the church. We were in line for over an hour and no one was let into the church. I went to investigate what was happening and found that at the same area you enter the monastery there is a “fast pass” entrance to the church for Lisbon Cardholders. Everyone was gaining access to the church from the fast pass entrance. The idiots like us who were lined up in the area that was clearly marked as entrance to the church were being ignored by the staff.Word spread quickly through the crowd and there was a scramble for the “fast pass line”.The staff are rude and belligerent so don’t expect them to provide guidance.We left after over 2 hours on line without entering the church or monastery"

On one hand, the Tower of Belem is one of the most famous landmarks in Lisbon, and broader, of the entire Portugal. Not only it is one of the finest examples of the so-called Manueline architectural style, the style that originated during the heyday of the Portuguese Empire, the golden Age of Discoveries, the style that was made possible due to the influx of capital that the Portuguese Discoveries triggered, and the style that incorporates the richness, the flourishing excesses, and the various naval elements, but also it is the landmark that braved the mass destructions of the 1775 earthquake. If only for that, a stop to tour the tower is a must on your agenda list. However, a five-minute stop is all it takes. There is barely anything interesting inside the tower, and for us it was just a fleeting glimpse at this historical and architectural marvel that sufficed. With that being said, there is no doubt the Torre de Belem should be included in your tour of Belem. One of the several wonders of Lisbon.

There is not much to see inside the building. There is a prison in the basement to which there is no tourist access. There are cannons on the main level. The steps to climb to the top of the tower are circular and steep and can be slippery when it rains. There is a red light/green light system which if followed by all visitors would prevent over crowding of the very narrow and circular staircase up to the top of the tower. Unfortunately most tourists didn’t understand the concept of not entering the staircase when the light at the entrance was red! The staff congregate together at the bottom of the stairs and there were no staff managing stairs the upper levels of the tower.The view from the top of the tower is nice but not a must see.If there is a long line up or if it is raining or the visibility is bad just view the tower from the outside and save both time and money.

They have recently changed the rules and only allow locals to drive near the palace. Either get a Tuk tuk or find parking in sintra and get the bus (or brave the walk) *we parked for free in the large parking lot opposite Portela De Sintra train station. Walk from here to sintra train station (10 minutes) and get on the 434 bus. You can get tickets in the queue for the bus, 6.9 euros return. First bus is 9.15am and there are lots of them early. *get here early!!! Queues form from early. *tickets to the palace can be bought before 10 from the automated machines (park & palace). If you want just park tickets - you need to wait for the ticket booths to open. You can also buy them online but this isn’t well advertised. *i think the palace was worth doing - although it’s not the most amazing. If you go to the palace - go in the entrance and go straight to the palace. Don’t wait for queues to build. The queues build back to the coffee shop and at that stage it’s not worth the wait. *after the palace, walk around at your leisure. Lots of ups and downs, there are tour buses around the place. But we covered most of the park in a couple of hours on a beautiful day. *bring a lunch/snacks - food in here is limited and expensive.

I wouldn’t bother with the unlimited day pass - there is not enough time to see enough castles to make use of it - and you then ascend to the palace entrance (taking a very long circuitous route - initially down into the valley to a bus stop where no one seems to get on).   There will likely be a queue for tickets.  It is then a steep, but doable, walk up to the castle, or you can pay Euros 3.50 to take a shuttle bus.The palace definitely looks best from afar - perhaps like some Disney creation - rather than up close where the need for restoration, or even some new paint, becomes clear.  There will be a queue to enter the building (maybe 20 - 30 mins) and you then snake through very, very, very slowly indeed through the rooms.  The interior rooms are not at all impressive - small (it was a former monastery, as well as a regal palace) with extremely dated and unimpressive furnishings.  The highlight is the view from the Queens Terrace, where you get a fine panorama of Lisbon, the bridge, river, etc.After exiting the castle, you can visit the gardens.  These are cold in the winter as you are high up and in the shade, so wear warmer clothing.  You can walk down and through the gardens, exiting via the Valley of the Lakes (where there is a little castle for the geese), and pick up a lower level bus stop, which then loops back past the Moors Castle and the Pena Castle entrance where you alighted earlier.

Long queues for tickets which were not clear. We did not pay extra for the bus so had to walk up to the palace. The queue to get in was miles long - we estimate 2 hours and nowhere to sit down so we didn’t bother. The grounds are wonderful and we had a great day walking to the interesting features and enjoying the amazing views. We wish we hadn’t paid for tickets to enter the palace as this was a waste of money.This palace and its grounds are not accessible for anyone with mobility problems.

I was very disappointed upon seeing the palace up close. Firstly, the entrance is disorganized and the queues to purchase tickets long. A ticket machine was down as it had run out of paper, exacerbating the crowding. The palace itself is overhyped. The exterior is in need of restoration work. The bright colors are old and worn. The cloister could use some serious cleaning. The interior is nothing special, especially when compared to other palaces across Europe. And this was after standing in line for an hour to get in. About the only redeeming factor was the excellent views of the Castelo dos Mouros from the terrace. At €14/person, I would rather have spent that money on cheap souvenirs than have wasted my time at Pena Palace.

We bought our tickets at the tourist office in the village of Sintra.  Then bought a bus ticket to get to the entrance  (6,90 Euros for all day circuit around to the major sites).  Once inside the gate, a wait in line and another 3,00 Euro bus ticket to get to the top of the hill.  And then a huge line to enter the palace.  We gave up at that point and waited in line to take the bus back down the hill.  A much better experience if you are young and  able-bodied!  But beautiful weather, lovely views, and crowds were all cheerful.

It was built in the XVI century and it is a fine example of Portuguese Late Gothic Manueline style. You can read about the history in specialized places, but I'm explaining a few tips I think are useful. There are two lines: one line to buy the tickets (10€ or, combined with the museum, 12€) and another line to enter the monastery. If you're a group, some people can make one line and the other, the other line. You'll save a lot of time.It's a very crowded place, so I think it's best if you go early in the morning or at the end of the day. In addition to the main monastery and halls, there's the church (another line). If you're in Belém for the day, you can come and visit the church at the end of the day, when there's no line and the church is empty.

We arrived by taxi and were dropped just by the archaeological museum, we decided to visit the museum before continuing to the monastery. As we went to purchase our tickets, we found that we were able to purchase a joint ticket for the archaeological museum as well as Jeronimos. This we did.  The visit to the museum was fine, with some Egyptian remains, as well as Roman etc. From the museum we walked to Jeronimos, there was quite a long queue for entry, but a separate section for those with tickets. We went to this section, with our tickets. The guard at the barrier then proceeded to shout at us and point to the back of the queue, we showed our tickets, with more aggression he grudgingly agreed that we could enter what we thought would be the church. It was not, the ticket gave us access to the cloisters, a small chapel and the refectory. Once we had seen these we then walked back to the entrance, where we informed that our tickets did not allow us access to the church. We are not even sure if payment was needed for this. But the only way to gain access was to “get to the back of the queue” we didn’t bother. So be aware of paying for a ticket that doesn’t even give access, that the guards are less than helpful and if our December visit is anything to go by, the queue for entry could be extremely long. All in all, a real disappointment.

It was amazing! Don’t let the size fool you, it is definitely beautiful and awe inspiring!

If you go in the summertime, it’ll probably be even busier, so I’d recommend going earlier in the day.

There was a long queue which we could skip since we had Lisboa Cards. However be prepared to que a little while since they let only 120 people in at time. Belém Tower or Torre de Belém is a 16th-century fortification built from a Lisboan limestone. It was built originally on a small island. The tower has served as a fortress and is a symbol of Portugal's Age of Discoveries. I climbed all the way up. Stairs were narrow but the view and tower itself was worth climbing. You do not have to climb all the way up at once but you can stop in different floors. There is actually a good system which shows you how to move from floor to floor but many visitors seemed to misunderstand it. On the top floor ""the traffic light"" shows when you can go down. And between the floors the digital clock's green light shows how long time you have to go up or down. However, many thought that it was time to wait until one could go.For visiting time approximately an hour is enough. Nice views and I recommend."

It is very beautiful, colourful and highly situated, meaning, a lot of walking involved. But it is well worth it. To get there, it is either by public bus 434 or one of those hop on hop off tour buses from the Sintra train station. They drop you off at the foot of the hill so you'll have to walk up slope for about 10 minutes to get to the palace. Once you're there, the bright colours and the intricate design of the palace will take your breath away. There is more walking as you explore both the inside and outside of the castle. Be prepared, the place will be crowded. Guaranteed.

Park is absolutely amazing and breathtaking. See some pictures below. Up the hill there is a Pena palace. But if there is a fog, you barley can see it. Price 7,50€ includ visiting park and Pena palace but only outside. If you like to see palace inside, you have to buy extra ticket. Visiting park and palac it's good to take 1-2 hours or more, If you are going to take a pictures and walking along the park etc. I hope you will have a a nice and clear day. If you have it, you will see Atlantic from top of the Pena palace. We do not have this opportunity. Before visiting check the local bus timetable otherwise you have to walk from train station up to the hill approximately 30 min. Prices for all  busses are apx. 20 €. We were group of four, so we were taking a local guide named Miguel (with working licenses) who stops us in the street and offers us a day trip with his car and sharing all the information he has, for 30 € per person. That doesn't include entry tickets for palace and park. His route includes visiting Cabo da Roca, driving along the coastline to a city Cascais, where you have train back to Lisbon (return ticket not valid, if you buy it from Sintra). Enjoy every second, like we did.

Founded on a site that had been visited by an apparition of the Virgin Mary, the initial settlement was a monastery for St Jerome. It was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake and it lay in ruins for many years until a young Ferdinand II decided to transform the site into a Summer Palace for the Portuguese Royal Family. The Portuguese State acquired the Palace and grounds in 1889 and after the Republican Revolution of 1910, it was classified as a National Monument and Museum.Over the years, the external paint had faded and was only seen with a grey and grab facade. Re-painted back to its formal glory, this small palace now draws hundreds of visitors daily. You can catch a train from Central Lisbon to Old Sintra. You will then either need to either hike up to the Park or take a local bus. I opted for an Uber from Central Lisbon. A taxi takes approximately 40 minutes each way and my Uber was about €25.00 (including tip) in each direction. Access to the Park (which is beautiful) and the outside of the Palace is just over €7.00 per adult. To view the interior, you will need to pay an extra €7.00. The Palace is beautiful. The interiors that are available for public view are small but very interesting. The entire site is wonderful to visit and good for families. I would recommend going in the morning as the Park and Palace can get quite busy in the afternoon.

But, at half way up to the hill, we were been instructed by local police to use another route. Then, this guy with his Tuk Tuk car was standing at road side stopping us and offered us to go up to Palace of Pena with his Tuk Tuk car service. He charged us with 10 euro on round trip each which we claimed too expensive. He explained that it was not allowed to reach top of the hill with private cars since July 2019. Mainly is because there is traffic control of private cars at top of the hill after overwhelming of tourists to visit the palace. He will send us back to get our car after the visit. As we don’t have other choice so we accepted it. When reaching the entrance, he requested us to pay him first and he promised will wait for us after 1hr visit. We asked him few questions to make sure he will wait for us and took his photo as assurance. After the visit, we went back to our car with his Tuk Tuk car service. But, he requested us to pay him the return trip with same charges! We refused and argued with him but he blocked our car with his Tuk Tuk car so that we cannot reverse our car to leave the place! He is a liar and purposely cheating tourists in this historical place. We were very disappointed and felt this is a shame on Portugal tourist image. If you have any plan to visit this place then do aware of this unlucky travel experience that happened on us.

Palacio de Pena is quirky and colourful but the hour long queue to enter, even with tickets (on 2nd January, so many locals may have been on holiday) is why I have given this a three star review.We shuffled around the inside of the Palace, behind everyone else for only 40 minutes for the whole palace, so it definitely wasn't worth the wait.If you have seen larger palaces in Europe, the interior is interesting but smaller.If you are short on time or can't queue, it's better to get a ticket for the terrace and park only which is also cheaper. You can walk around a large section of the top of the castle and the views from this terrace/ walkway is great.

We researched the website and it recommended to utilize the self service kiosks located in the lobby.The only methods to purchase tickets is to purchase the Lisbon Card which includes several attractions (we already visited the others), or to purchase just the monastery ticket, or just the archaeological museum or a combination ticket for the monastery and the archaeological museum via the kiosk.Signage is lacking along sidewalks and the exteriors of the multiple buildings.  Upon arrival there were multiple long lines of people most of whom were unsure which line was correct for them.There were limited employees outside directing the crowds and most were too busy chatting amongst themselves or playing on their phones.The result is thousands of people in incorrect lines wasting time.After the third line and standing in line a long time we finally arrived at the kiosk. Only two kiosks were functional and the third was only for official tour guides to purchase group tickets.  The kiosks accept cash or credit cards BUT both were having problems and would only accept the denomination of the 20 euro paper bill. Tickets for nonresidents are priced at 12 euros each. So the majority of people trying to pay with cash and only having 5 or 10 euro bills had to leave the line to go stand in another INSANE line for the one cashier at the gift shop to exchange money for the 20 euro bills.At this point Chris and I were very upset and debating to abandon the visit to these beautiful monuments.We were paying with a VISA credit card and finally made it to the kiosk. The touch screen was disgusting and had looked like it had dried snot on it.It printed the tickets then we had to stand in another line to actually enter. The tickets have both barcodes and QR code’s so we assumed we could just scan the tickets and enter BUT no!!! The elderly person guarding the door had to examine the tickets in slow motion and then tear each ticket in random places.  We saw a bag check near the bathrooms upon arrival but no one and no signs state that bag check was mandatory. The museum is free for residents of Portugal and the men and women all had backpacks and sizable purses.  We viewed the left half of the museum and walked across the lobby to the largest portion of the museum only to be told we cannot enter unless we check our bags. Chris and I both had across the shoulder messenger bags less than seven inches inside and barely large enough to hold our cellphones and a map.  Meanwhile locals with large bags walked right in!!!We then had to go back to the other side of the building for bag check only to discover that the lockers are automatic and only accept a 1 euro coin. We didn’t have any coins and were then told to stand in line at the gift shop and exchange paper euros. We get to the gift shop and the one cashier has a line of people waiting to exchange money for the lockers.At this point we had wasted hours standing in lines and unable to see much of what we had paid for.  We met many many other unhappy tourists just as frustrated as we were.The employees that operate these landmarks need customer service training, better signage, improved active organization for crowd control and the ability to purchase e-tickets online with self scanning tollgates.The buildings, structures and artwork are incredible but the complete experience is a disaster due to the manner in which the facilities are operated.Until the staff and government can rectify these issues, we don’t recommend these interconnected attractions.

The Belem Tower of course is a main point of interest, and close to the tower - a short walk by the water, is a spectacular monument.  Across the busy multi-lane highway is actually the residential and  small business area as well as the breathtaking Belem Cathedral - well worth the visit and no charge.   It's an easy stroll ""downtown"" and there is the famous Belem Pastel de Natal bakery - home of the original pastry.  There are multiple restaurants on this street, as well as a few on the water between the tower and the monument.  This is an easy and lovely half day trip out of central Lisbon."

Also known as ""Santuário do Bom Jesus de Braga"", it is a symbol of the Christian faith and of the importance of the Roman Catholic Church in Portugal. Around the 14th century, a primitive ermitage was erected at the top of ""Monte de Espinho"" and it soon became a center of Christian pilgrimage. Years later, in 1784, Archbishop Dom Gaspar de Bragança commissioned Portuguese architect Carlos Luís Ferreira da Cruz Amarante the construction of the actual Sanctuary. It was finally inaugurated in 1811 and is one of the first Neoclassical constructions in Portugal, but Baroque and Rococo characteristics can also be seen. A monumental staircase and a beautiful elevator connect the lower part of ""Monte de Espinho"" to the Sanctuary itself, at its top. The staircase - with all its chapels, statues, fountains and points of observation - symbolizes the sacred route to the ""Way of the Cross"" and a rite of penitential purification. Unmissable to all those visiting Braga and, remember, Unesco has appointed the ""Santuário do Bom Jesus do Monte"", in 2019, a ""World Heritage Site""! Enjoy!"

We made the mistake of driving, but there is no parking and so we had to park about a mile away on the road and walk back along narrow steep roads. So, I would recommend getting an Uber which are cheap and easy to get in Sintra, or even a bus.Secondly, getting in. There were huge queues for tickets - so I advise getting your tickets online at blueticket.pt (or any other ticket site). You can do this on your mobile when you get there and it simply show the online ticket as you go in and you avoid all the queues. The price is €10 er adult, €5 for seniors and children and children under 5 are free,Once inside, we first walked around the gardens, and then he house.The place it a UNESCO World Heritage site and was built at the turn of the 20th Century by millionaire Antonio Monteiro and designed by Italian architect Luigi Manini. The park feature a variety of wells, grottoes, lakes, fountains etc and has a real fairytale feel. Apparently the designs feature symbols related to Alchemy, Masonry, The Knights Templar and the Rosicrucians.We started near the top of the gardens where you can find the unique ""Initiation Well"" which is not really a well but a deep hole with a galleried staircase that you can take don to the bottom. The moss covered structure is both beautiful and unusual.We then snaked our way down the gardens, past many strange and unusual structures like towers and fountains. Sadly the waterfalls were undergoing maintenance and not functioning but you could see they would be quite spectacular if operating.Finally, we explored the house, which is a beautiful gothic style palace with stunning views of the Moorish Palace and glimpses of Pena Palace.Though we visited at the end of February, the weather was amazing (20C) and the gardens were splendidly green and beautiful. So this can be a great time to visit as I imagine there could be huge crowds in summer.Overall Quinta da Regaleira was, in my opinion, one of the high spots of Sintra, which should not be missed."

There are good reasons for this. German Romanticism was also noted here. But not by Ludwig II, but by Fernando II, who was originally Ferdinand of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty. The German Prince Consort, having married the Portuguese Queen Maria II, was noted in the history of not only Pena, but also a large number of children. If we talk about Freud, then maybe that's why Neuschwanstein turned out to be much cooler than Pen. Ferdinand's sexual appetite was not completely sublimated in architecture like Ludwig's. And poor Maria on the 12th child could not stand it and died in childbirth. Like Neuschwanstein, the Foam is built on the site of an existing building. And unlike the Bavarian counterpart, part of the previous chapel was built into the palace. The chapel survived the earthquake of 1755, unlike the rest of the monastery. The natural element showed artistic taste and legibility in Sintra: it was the chapel with an alabaster altar by Nicolas Chanterin, the author of the portal in the monastery of Geronimos, that survived. Lieutenant-General and mining engineer Wilhelm Ludwig von Eschwege, a German amateur architect, led the construction of the royal couple's summer residence. Construction was carried out between 1842 and 1854 with the active participation of both the Queen (she was constantly pregnant and had no time for state affairs) and King Ferdinand, who became King after the conception of the heir. The palace turned out to be a celebration of eclecticism. All the sentences probably began with the words:"" And let's add more... "" And then to taste. According to the taste of the person who was offering at that moment. Here, pseudo-Gothic, let's then anything Portuguese (Azulejos?). Let's put a Moorish dome on it, surround it with a wall with battlements, paint it all yellow and add a pink tower. And you forgot! Let's also put a clock on the tower! O. K. Cool! If you think it's just outside, then you're wrong! The royal chambers and the state and ballrooms look just as pretentious. The continuation of the Moorish dome will be an Arab Hall for some reason with tromple paintings, but the Indian Hall has no connotation in the exterior. Probably there was not enough space for a Jain temple or a Buddhist stupa. Travel guides advise you to take a break from the riot of colors in the park. From the riot-yes, everything is more or less green there, but from the eclecticism-no! The park is a huge 240-hectare collection of plants and trees from all over the world - from American redwoods to Japanese Cryptomeria. It was believed that this makes the atmosphere of the park healing, especially for allergy sufferers and asthmatics. Making your way along the winding paths past picturesque eucalyptus trees, Australian ferns and authentic local lichens, you really relax..."

It was built in 1850 by King consort Ferdinand II on the site of a previous monastery which was destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.You cannot reach the palace by car as the roads to it are limited to buses, taxis and tuk tuks. You can get a bus from Sintra centre, but we chose to go by Uber which I would highly recommend as it cost us just €4.50 which is cheaper than the buses seemed to be. Even so, you can only go as far as the foot of a steep 500m hill up to the palace, but there are minibus transfers (€3) for those that cannot make this final ascent. We chose to walk, and it is a little exhausting but worth it.To avoid queuing for tickets I strongly advise you buy them online at a site like tiqets.com. You can easily do that when you arrive and show the ticket on your phone.We had been told that the inside of the palace is not that amazing so we chose to buy tickets just for the grounds, which were €7 each. These allow you to walk around the grounds but also to access the terraces of the palace, where you get the most spectacular views. You can see all the way to the sea, and all the way to Lisbon. You also get a great view of the nearby Moorish Castle. But you must go on a clear day as the palace often gets engulfed in cloud when a visit would be pointless.Pena Palace is worth visiting for the views alone, but also for the fairytale disney like architecture of the palace. I highly recommend it.As a final tip, you can combine your trip with a visit to the Moorish Castle which is fairly easy to walk to from Pena Palace. We went there after and then called an Uber to go back down. In retrospect this may have been better the other way around as I think that Ubers tend to wait at the Pena Palace for rides so you might get one quicker there as the roads are one way and they cannot go back to the Moorish Castle by road.

This palace is set in stunning gardens and is atop a hill with amazing views and is such beautiful colours.I have some tips on this one. Everyone told me N OT to go inside the interior of the palace itself, but I didn't listen and wanted to see for myself.  They were right. Some of the rooms are beautiful of course, but it's such a slow and boring wait as you follow a queue moving through the rooms. You are also not allowed to take photos which is disappointing. However the gardens and outside of the building (you can still walk around the terraces if you don't pay extra for the interior) are stunning!!!! My 2nd tip is when you get the bus up the hill, get off at the first stop which is the gardens.  Walk through because they are beautiful and then up to the castle and walk round, have a drink in the cafe or restaurant and then walk down to the Moorish Castle.

The Palace of Pena was essentially a massive PR exercise by German-born Ferdinand The Second. He pulled out all the stops to impress his newly acquired-by-marriage Portuguese subjects on this one. It took him 20 years to cram every cultural reference he could into his astounding edifice in an effort to demonstrate an empathy with Portugal. The fact that he chose to build it on top of an inaccessible mountain was incidental. Pena puts other European palaces to shame for their single-mindedness. Absolutely enthralled by it.

It is an astonishing testament to the vision of King Ferdinand II and architect Baron von Eschwege and draws on myriad architectural styles to create a truly unique building. Whether you like the various styles or not is almost by the by. Just soak it all up and appreciate its eccentricity, safe in the knowledge that nothing even remotely like this will ever be built again.And do not miss the park - it is stunning, with an almost fairytale-like quality (a chain of lakes with waterfalls, labyrinthine paths, a tiny chapel, moss-covered benches, lush ferns, multiple fountains and an incredible array of trees from around the globe).

The ticket of Pena costs 14 Euro for an adult, 12.5 Euro for a child. What might stun a tourist is only the bright colors of the outside architecture, but the decoration of the inside palace is not worth mentioning, if you have been to one of the royal palaces or the representative Roman catholic churches. What i would like to mention is the security conditions in Sintra. There is a public parking lot downhill of Pena Palace, five- hundred meters away from the nearest police office. We lost our two backpacks in the public parking lot. The robber(s) used a screw driver to open the door of the rental car, and took away our backpacks in which contained all our valuable belongings. We went to report the case, the police were indifferent, or more accurately, they were onlookers to watch a melodrama happening to someone who has no relationship with. I called up the car rental company Centauro, their reply was more aweful to hear. What they concerned was their car, the staff who received my phone call inquired whether the car was stolen or whether the car was seriously damaged. When we returned the car at the denominated time and expressed our fury toward the quality we received from Centauro.The staff who received us promised Centauro would watch into this case and give us a satisfactory reply to the handling of this case. He even promised he would copy the reporting document and marked the robbery we suffered on the contract of concluding the rent. But more than half a month has passed, no explanation and no apology were sent from Centauro. The following claim for compensation is hard to achieve. What aroused my fury is the indifferent attitude and no action taken throughout the case.If a country does not know how to show a humanistic concern to a foreign travellers, does it deserve the future international travellers to go. I am sure a traveller with sense and right judgement will see the potential danger of security you have to measure before leaving for Portugal, the possible holiday destination.

We  where  recommended by our  driver  to  buy  from the beginning the  tickets for  both Castels also  for Castle of the Mauros, as we  get  a small discount. I Recomend that  you  start at  the  low  gate  and go up  through the  park all  the  way  to  the  Castle it's a 20 min hike or more  depending how long you will  stay  to  admire the  scenery and views and  the  way  you go up. We  did not take  tickets to visit the  castle inside  as our  guide  said  that inside we  can  see only some of  the  old  furniture and  it is  not  worth to pay  for  it. So  we took  the  terrace access tickets and  we  where more  than  satisfied. The  Castle itself from  the  beginning looks amazing and  going up  gets better you have  to go  through  the  wall pass and  go  around  the  castle walls   on  the  outside,  the  views  are  spectacular.  We went out of the  castle park throw the  main top gate  and  went down  the hill to  the Castle of the Mauros ( Castelo dos Mouros) also  a 20 min walk we  just  followed the  signs and  we  had  also  a map  that  was  helpful.

Access to the place is monopolised by bands of roaming tuk tuk drivers looking unsavoury in the best instance, like cut-purses in the worst; or by a bus where you can only stand and pay 4 euro for the privilege. Cattle-like queues for purchasing entry tickets, even if it was early in the day and not many tourists were there, automatic machine broken down and derelict. An additional 3 euros if you cannot walk up the last bit through the park and want to wait 15 mins for a lazy minibus where again you can only stand up. These people are absolutely ignorant of queue management, they keep sending you through the labyrinth even if numbers are low. Worst of all, one of us is visibly disabled and she asked gently whether she could be let through the main gate without having to do a totally unnecessary labyrinth, and of course she was told no by a smirking female attendant at the gate supported by a tough looking individual in some sort of uniform. After she and all of us went though the empty labyrinth and got to her again she answered our (loud) complaints with an additional smirk and an expression of incredulity that anybody could question her authority and intelligence, and berating in a loud voice the disabled member of our party (don't worry, we answered back).Once finally inside the blessed castle, which is quite narrow in its interiors, the way was blocked by a massive group standing in one of the best rooms listening to a speaker/guide. In any civilised museum on this earth, it is customary that a guide harangues their group out of the main transit way and not in front of exhibits if they block other visitors view: not here. When one of us went to challenge the speaker/guide, one of the group got agitated and communicated that the speaker/guide was actually the director of the place, and he could do as he wanted. At our complaints, th situation deteriorated and one of that group, that was composed of Portuguese teachers, got insulting.  One of us got square with the director and demanded our entry fees back from the director there and then, to which he gracefully retreated, taking the astonished teachers with him. Nothing dramatic to report after that. Just a thought, it must be nice job, if you can get it, to be a museum director in Portugal if all the others were like this (they are not)."

Because it's the only place in Paris where you can't see it. The Ponte de Dom Luís I, which was built by Eiffel's disciple Théophile Seyrig, is good when you look at it and when you look from it. It is no accident that the bridge was included in various ratings of the best bridges in the world and together with the nearby monastery was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. But the main thing is that the bridge is the best viewing platform in Porto. From here you can enjoy wonderful views of the Ribeira and Vila Nova de Gaia quays, the Douro River and the whole city. The bridge has two tiers. By the way, Eiffel lost the competition to his student and companion due to the fact that he proposed a single-tier bridge, which even then in 1886 didn`t match the demographic growth of Porto. Pedestrian paths are available on each of them. Each of them is not without its drawbacks.The path on the lower tier is separated from the traffic by a fence, but it is very narrow - the width of a person. Of course, the best views are from the upper span of the bridge. However, here the pedestrian path is not separated from the roadway in any way. Fortunately, only high-speed trams run here. You can walk freely on the bridge in both directions. Interestingly, the bridge was paid until 1944. Now selfies from the bridge are free. The main thing is not to drop the smartphone in the Douro...

The views are phenomenal and a good few spots fro some great photos. You arrive at the other side of the river and you can access the chair lift for a few euros which,again, has great views and takes you right into the centre of the Vila Nova de Gaia where you can sample a few ports in the old lodges which house the port producers. Alternately you can take the walkway across the bottom of the bridge accessed from the bottom end of Ribeira and arrive at the edge of Vila Nova de Gaia, walk through the market stalls which sell Portuguese goodies at a fraction of the price you would pay in Porto itself. You can walk near the rivers edge and sample the port lodges as well as sampling some of the many restaurants and bars. You can then get the local ferry across the river back to  Ribera..

Inside what was once the monks’ library is a very unusual exhibition: a circular 500 year timeline tracing what was happening in the world, in Portugal and on the monastery grounds itself."

In every weather and at all hours the high walls fantastically carved out of white stone with curious manueline seafaring details are suggestive of the lost beach at their feet from where the caravels would once have sailed off, Godspeed mass having been chanted with the monks. Getting inside the church, its noble spaciousness and unique proportions seem appropriate to the tombs of many famous Portuguese linked to the pioneer oversea expeditions. The whole place is intimately connected with those adventurous times. The high vaults seem to linger on a different, spiritual plane, not so much supported by the surprisingly slender and elegant columns as retained by them like by so many tight cables to prevent that giant white sail from floating away in the breeze. Surely a Zeppelin above one’s head wouldn’t feel as light as this huge stony horizontal surface. The simplicity of the choir built later in the understated elegance of the “Portuguese plain style” is breathtakingly beautiful in its perfect proportions and blends in just so. The museums now contained in the monastery are small and interesting especially for children as you have a few Egyptian rooms with the usual captivating things as well as treasure rooms with plenty impressive Celtic and Tartessian gold torques. The navy museum displays the very beautiful river-party boats of the royalty.The cafeteria across the pedestrian square from the navy museum on the western side of the monastery offers nice snacks and plats du jour and has tables outside. Walking away from the church on the eastern side you’ll get to the famous Pastéis de Belém tea room and across the street from it are the bus stops back to the center. If you’re spending the day in the area I would recommend visiting also the CCB modern art center, the Coaches museum in its beautiful modern building by famous Brazilian architect and have lunch or dinner at the funny Synfonia restaurant, inside a football stadium with marvelous river views. You’ll find it a short distance walking uphill 10 minutes along Avenida Ilha da Madeira at number 13.

Similarly, in the XVI century, Portugal for seafarers ended and began here. The official name of the tower is Saint-Vincenti, because it is dedicated to the patron saint of the city. Accordingly, the statue of St. Vincent adorns the northern facade. In the company of the Archangel Michael. Initially, this symbol of the colonial expansionism of little Portugal was a defensive project. The tower was built in 1515-1521 by Francisco de Arruda, the architect of the Portuguese fortresses in Morocco. Its task is to guard the mouth of the Tagus along with the forts on the other side of the river. The gun casemates and barracks were placed in the tower and bastion nearby. However, the tower did not gain fame in this capacity. The troops of the famous Spanish general the Duke of Alba took it in 1580 after only a few hours of battle. The Spaniards who occupied Portugal set up a prison here, changing the purpose. The convenient location contributed to the use and as a customs post until the XIX century. The Romanticist movement, which helped restore many medieval buildings in Europe, also attracted attention to the Belen Tower. The tower, which was already used as a lighthouse and telegraph office, was reconstructed in a more medieval form than it was in reality. UNESCO listed the Torre de Belen as a World Heritage Site and described it as one of the best examples of the Manuelino style. It is logical that it was included in the informal list of 7 wonders of Portugal.

Luckily, we had Lisboa cards which allowed us to jump into the Prepaid lineup which was served first. Every 30 mins, they allow 80 people to enter the tower. When we reached the front of the lineup, we discovered that the top tower was closed due to ""security reasons"". We were only able to access the lower level and the main deck. We spent around 15 mins in the tower altogether (taking our time). They also had the bottom level (the old prisoner cells) closed when we visited. Luckily, because of our Lisboa Cards, we only waited 45 mins and our tickets were included. If I had paid 5 euros/person after having waited in line for such a long time, without being told until I got to the front of the line that the top tower was closed, I would have been very annoyed (and based on other people's reactions, they were very annoyed).

It was the most wonderfully wacky palace I’ve ever seen. It The extensive gardens are an indulgence of lush plantings, secret grottoes and a labyrinth of paths. However, the ticket system is another matter and it is unnecessarily confusing. I suspect that many people end up buying the €14 Palace & Garden ticket when they only really want the €7 Garden. This is because the labels are misleading. It makes it sound like the cheaper ticket restricts you to the gardens only but this isn’t the case. The cheaper ‘garden’ ticket still allows you onto all the castle terraces and the castle wall. Basically all the amazing photos you see of the red, yellow and blue exterior are taken using the garden ticket. You don’t need to pay more to access these areas. The only thing you cannot do, is go inside the furnished rooms of the Palace.What the €14 ticket gives you is access to the furnished rooms. I was keen to see them so we bought the €14 and they were very interesting. However many people would be happy to skip this part. If you’re undecided, it is worth noting that the line to go inside gets quite long and there is a very strictly enforced no photo rule in this part of the palace. If you are buying the €14 ticket, make sure you keep it handy after the main gate because you’ll have to show it a second time to get into the palace rooms.

They're not wrong. The unique thing about this palace is that it has architecture from a variety of different eras due to different cultures constantly overthrowing each other. It's quite considerate, actually, that they decided not to completely demolish the palace but to simply add on to it. Hence the multi-colored and eclectic appearance. The inside is interesting, but it does get crowded and it's quite a long tour. So if you like that sort of thing - you'll love this. For those that don't and can get a bit antsy or only hear so much history - you can sneak past the larger tour groups holding things up and just stop at the places you want to check out. In my opinion - the outside was the best part. Beautiful flora and fauna, plenty of fresh air, and gorgeous views of Portugal.

It was raining lightly the next morning, but nothing disruptive, so we hopped aboard the 434 shuttle bus without taking the time to look up to the hills surrounding Sintra. Had we done so, we would have realized how totally enveloped in clouds the palace can be. It was cold, it was damp, and visibility shrouded some of the palace itself while we were there.None of that, of course, is the palace’s fault; it is a five-star attraction in terms of what you see and what you can learn, so I am not about to reduce its ranking over our decision. Get the audio guide from the gift shop that is ahead of you as you enter to get the most out of it. And by all means, go early in the day as we did. But if you can arrange your visit to avoid a rainy day, do something else that day in Lisbon or Sintra itself -- and come here when visibility does not negatively impact the experience as it sometimes can.Finally, no matter when you go, if you have any mobility issues or tire easily, take the shuttle bus that picks you up just past the admission gates. It can make quite a difference."

It was crowded (esp. the bus) because the weather was perfect, but I'm sure even more crowded  during the high season. First, if you have mobility issues and/or difficultly climbing, this might not be the best excursion for you. We chose to walk up from the Moorish Castle because of the LONG wait for the very crowded buses. The 10 minute or so  walk was easy for us, slightly up hill through a wooded area, but might not be as easy for others. Once at the Pena Palace entrance, you buy either a ticket for the grounds or a ticket for grounds and interior of palace. The only  reason to buy the interior ticket is for the magnificent views from the balconies-- I  was not overly impressed with the palace interior and moved quickly through it. You have to walk up a long incline to reach the palace and it it take some fitness to do this easily, esp. on a hot day. You can pay for a tram, but they seemed to run infrequently  --  people were complaining that there were no trams. The grounds are very wooded-- it was  early March so not much floral display then. The exterior of the palace is very  colorful/whimsical, but doesn't  seem in  the best repair. I'm glad I did it, but I don't think I would do it again.

I loved the fernery and the valley of the lakes.  It almost feels other worldly.  One of the best experiences in Sintra!  Buy tickets in advance if possible.  The line is crazy, even in early spring.  Also, be aware that Uber drivers have to pay for a special pass to get to Pena Palace.

Entry to the church is free but you will pay €10 for the cloisters. Unless you're on a very tight budget, don't skip the cloisters. It is just so beautiful and the gloomy, dark church does not prepare you at all for the magnificence of the cloisters and monastery grounds. Commissioned by King Manuel I in 1501, the monastery is lavishly decorated with ornate stonework that incorporates all sorts of maritime motifs and animal figures with regal and Christian symbols. This is where the great Portugese seafarers, explorers and navigators like Vasco de Gama came for confession and spiritual guidance immediately before launching off on long and treacherous voyages to chart new lands. TICKETS & LINES:* Avoid Mondays – it's not open* The combo Monastery/Belem Tower ticket no longer exists. Our guide book still showed it as available even though we had the latest edition. * In hindsight, I wish we had bought the Lisboa 1 day Card for our trip to Belem. At €20, it would have given us free entry to the tower, monastery and coach museum and also free travel, saving us at least €10pp.* There are 2 lines, the longer line on the right is for free entry to the church and the left hand line is for the cloisters. Frustratingly, the cloisters ticket, doesn't give you any advantage in getting into the church. You have to exit the monastery grounds and line up again. The church line gets very long. If you're there early, I'd recommend visiting the church first when the line is likely to be shortest. * the ticket office is not immediately obvious. We joined the monastery queue, thinking this was for tickets and wasted some time before we realised our mistake. The ticket office is over to the left of the queue, by the museum entry.

They were probably trying to keep the crowds low inside the open air monastery  due to Corona, but ironically created crowds and long waits outside to go in.  It was beautiful, but we had to ask a worker if there was more to see and were we missing it?  Nope. That was it.  Conversely, the church was beautiful and a must to see.  The grave of Vasco da Gama, the empty grave, beautiful carvings, breathtakingly beautiful church, and impressive architecture were all free to see and required us to stand, yet again, in a long line.  This was totally worth it.  Our advice--- See the church, skip the monastery.

Although the tower is currently closed due to the pandemic, under normal circumstances I would say it is absolutely worth it. I thought it was excellent and having seen inside, I’d have been disappointed to miss it. The views from the watchtowers are stunning the views and it was amazing to be standing in an ancient tower, looking out across the water in exactly the same spot that sentries stood 500 years ago, guarding the entrance to the harbour.TIPS:* The joint Monastery/Tower ticket is no longer available. If I’d known earlier, I’d have bought the 1 day Lisboa card (€20) for our trip to Belem. This would have given us free travel and free entry to the tower, monastery and coach museum. This would’ve been a saving of at least €10pp and we could’ve joined the shorter lines for those with a card. Normal entry is €6* It’s closed on Mondays. Actually don't plan to go to Belem on Monday at all because the Monastery is also closed* It's difficult to tell which line is which. One is for tour groups, another for Lisboa card holders and another for those (like us) who were buying tickets on entry. Double-check that you’re in the right line because some poor people found themselves in the wrong line and had to start queuing all over again. * There are a lot of narrow spiral stone staircases so it won’t suit anyone with bad knees or mobility issues. However you don't have to climb all of the stairs at once, like a bell-tower. There are 5 floors leading to a roof terrace but you only need to do one flight at a time to each level so you get a break in between.* Information inside is very good * Look out for the rhinocerous sculpture. It's a tragic story. Manuel I received the rhino as an extravagant gift from the Sultan Muzafar of India in 1515. The rhino survived a hazardous 4 month journey chained on the deck of a ship, but on arrival, Manuel thought it was a good sport to pit the rhino against an elephant in a fight and then, tiring of it, he dressed the animal up in a green velvet collar decorated with golden roses and carnations and shipped it off to Pope Leo X. Sadly the ship was wrecked and the poor rhino drowned. However you can still see the rhino head carved on the side of a watchtower.

I bought the regular ticket, without entry to the castle itself. The palace is beautiful, but almost too perfect. It reminded me of Phantasialand in Germany ;) The colors are very vibrant.There's enough to see around the castle without getting inside. Beautiful viewpoints and amazing architecture. Worth the visit!I read some negative reviews as to being able to reach it. It is high up on a mountain, so there will be a lot of walking involved. We arrived to Sintra by train and took a shuttle car that dropped us off at a 10 minute walk from the palace, perfect! After our visit we walked all the way down past the Moorish castle."

Mostly in the shade but extremely peaceful and somewhat scenic.Inside the palace is nice, but if you are like me, once you’ve been inside a palace, castle or anything royal from the Moorish time period, you’ve pretty much already seen it.   The trip is meant for the view and the pictures on outside and terraces inside.Cost 14 eurosTime (allocate anywhere from 2-5 hours depending  on how much you like to take photos.   I did some where in the middle of 3.5 hours from start to finish.There’s bathrooms inside the park (palace grounds, for no fee).There’s a restaurant/cafe on grounds where you can sit out doors.I brought water, wine, tarts (pasties de nata) and since restaurant was half full, I decided to have my snacks there (I wouldn’t do this normally but it was only half full, so figured it was ok).All in all a great way to spend the day!!

All I would say is that it is a long hike and in 32 degrees heat it Will be quite hard.  We opted for a 10 euro tuk tuk which took us part way up leaving us a steep 20 25 min walk up to the palace.

They told me the car was not ready due to extra cleaning and Covid!!!They lied ... they had plenty of cars ...we just arrived early and had a later booking slot.GOLDCAR maybe advertize to have good or even crazy rates but they overcharge and rob where they can...Yesterday i returned the car in Lisbon sirport again...all was checked...all was said to be fine and then they take an extra of 50euro for extra cleaning!!!Beware of Goldcar its dishonest.

The 15e tram or bus from the main square by Rossio station takes you straight out to Belem within 30 mins. You can either buy a ticket on-board or use a day card like we did. The area is very well preserved and good for walking and taking pictures in the area. It's best to get there before the coach parties turn up on mass, so we got there before 10.30am and it was really quiet. The trams and buses are really frequent, so that helps.

Due to the one way traffic system it seems a longer than expected drive but at €12 avoided a 15 minute walk to the bus station and waiting for a bus. The drop off was the same as the bus outside the palace grounds gate. It is then a ten minute walk or €3 per person bus to the castle. An uphill but easy walk. Very individual colouring gives it a striking appearance and it is beautiful from many viewpoints and turrets of the castle. We were there early and in these Covid times it was quite quiet, a few dozen people at different places in the grounds, walkways and turrets. We later entered the palace, takes the price from €7.50 to €14, not worth it if you expect lavish interiors expensively furnished. There are quite a few rooms in the palace but compared to many palaces the rooms are quite small, nicely furnished with antique pieces, but not very grandiose. There are a couple of rooms larger and grander but not especially ornate, certainly no Peles Castle of Romania. By the time we were leaving at 11.30 it was busy, not pre Covid levels but busy enough to start to feel crowded.  Leaving it was a 15 minute downhill walk to Mouros Castle. And after viewing that a 30 minute downhill forest walk to the historic centre.

Somebody took some time to think this one out in addition to perching it on a mountain top.  The views from several points is wonderful.  We were there on a cloudy day so didn't get the full perspective but still made for some amazing sights.  The detail involved and the time and labor it took to complete this is hard to fathom but makes for an enjoyable experience when you look around closely and take it all in.  Explore the grounds a little and decide if you want to take the 20-30 minute walk to the Moorish castle from the palace.  The full grounds are a full day if you try that and then you need to plan on eating lunch at the palace.  Do not try to walk here from town as you would exhaust yourself just getting up the mountain to the park and then it's still a lot of walking if you take some time.

Great place with small kids (trop de queue pour le puit Iniciático ? feintez par la sortie de grota do oriente)

However the management really did not do a good job with the cutting of paths due to corona-related safety measures. Most of the paths are cut off and there is no warning on the website or at the entrance or ticket office. So, we were counting to be able to have a normal visit here, but most of the little corners that made the place really special are inaccessible.Overall maybe it is just bad management...

The castle has only a small bit of history versus the main castle in town. I have been to castles all over the world and this was “nice”. As a first responder let me warn you, Let me warn you that they allow it to get extremely dangerously crowded. In an emergency there is a high likelihood of injury or death.If you are determined to go you should buy an online time ticket in advance. The lines to get into the castle are upwards of four hours!! The timed ticket you buy allows you to skip the four hour line and walk right in!! Really! When we did it we got all sorts of nasty looks and hisses but they let us right in. No four hour wait. You just have to keep saying excuse me, excuse me, and continue to walk/push your way to the interior entrance. If you are not comfortable asking people to step aside for you, don’t bother buying the ticket but rather just stay in line.

Fascinating castle like nothing I've ever seen.  Inside every room is different and unusual.

I don't suggest the internal part of the palace if you are not strongly interested in history/you can afford to easily spend double the price. We went ad came back on foot, perfectly fine if you like hiking.

But I wouldn’t recommend buying a Palace ticket. You can walk on all of the terraces and balconies with just a park ticket and see all of the best views. I’m sure Palace inside is great but there was a 1.5 hour queue just to get inside the Palace once we were inside the park and there’s plenty of other things to see in Sintra.A couple of other tips:1) Bring a jumper, it’s very windy. 2) Get a cab if you’ve gone to the train station. It cost €5 on Uber/Bolt/Free Now and is well worth it. That walk looks rough. 3) Be warned that it’s very touristy. It didn’t ruin it by any stretch of the imagination, but don’t be fooled by the empty pictures that you’ll see online. Definitely worth a visit, just spent your money where it’s useful - cabs not palace!

Easily could spend a whole day here. We were travelling in a camper van and when we broke down and couldn’t make the day we had booked for they were incredibly helpful and accommodating in moving our booking at no extra cost. Highly recommend
